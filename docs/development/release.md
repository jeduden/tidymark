title: Release Pipeline
summary: >-
  How a maintainer-dispatched workflow run publishes
  mdsmith to npm, PyPI, the Visual Studio Marketplace,
  Open VSX, and GitHub Releases — the workflow
  structure, the OIDC trusted publishers it relies on,
  the `release` environment that gates every publishing
  job, the separate website deploy, and the
  supply-chain hardening features baked into the
  pipeline.

# Release Pipeline

`.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes mdsmith to
every channel below. Release-time secrets travel as
short-lived OIDC tokens. The remaining long-lived
PATs are gated by the `release` GitHub environment.
Each channel has its own file under
`release-channels/`; the catalog re-renders on
`mdsmith fix`.

## Triggering a Release

A maintainer opens the **Release** workflow in the
Actions tab, clicks **Run workflow**, enters the
version (e.g. `v0.13.0`), and confirms. The run pauses
on the `release` environment's required-reviewer gate;
one approval releases every channel.

`release.yml` triggers solely on `workflow_dispatch`
with a required `version` input. It does not trigger
on `push`, tags, the `release` event,
`pull_request_target`, or `workflow_run`. The Releases
UI cannot drive the pipeline directly. A draft release
never creates a tag. The pipeline also owns the
release object (draft → upload → publish), so an
externally created release would collide.

The `release` job creates the tag itself: `tag_name` and
`target_commitish` on the `action-gh-release` step
point it at the dispatched commit (the branch chosen
in the form, normally `main`). A `preflight` job
validates the `version` input first. It is read
through an env var, never interpolated into a shell.
So a typo fails fast and nothing publishes.

The `release` job uploads every asset to a **draft**
release first. It then publishes the draft as a
separate final step. That step runs
`mdsmith-release publish-release`. Uploading to a
published release is rejected once immutable releases
are on. So the publish must be the last action. The
result is an immutable release.

GitHub writes the release notes. The
`softprops/action-gh-release` step sets
`generate_release_notes: true`. The notes list merged
PRs and commits since the previous tag.

`concurrency: { group: release, cancel-in-progress:
false }` serializes release runs. Two publish jobs
never mint OIDC tokens against the same registry at
once. The flag lets an in-flight publish finish.
Cancelling mid-publish would desync the platform
packages from the root.

## Job Topology

`build` feeds binaries to `npm`, `pypi`, `vscode`,
and `release`. `vscode` chains off `build` (it runs
`mdsmith-release build-npm` on the artifacts so the
`.vsix` bundles a binary for every platform).
`release` runs `smoke-test` against the fresh `npm`,
`pypi`, and `mise` channels. Every credential-bearing job is
gated by `if: github.repository == 'jeduden/mdsmith'`
and runs in the `release` GitHub environment.

The website deploy is a **separate workflow**,
`.github/workflows/pages.yml`. It builds
[mdsmith.dev](https://mdsmith.dev/) from `website/`
and deploys it to GitHub Pages. It runs on every push
to `main` under `docs/**` or `website/**`, so a docs
change ships the site with no tool release. A
maintainer can also deploy on demand: the
`workflow_dispatch` trigger appears as **Run
workflow** in the Actions tab. A tool release ships
it too: `release.yml`'s `pages` job gates on the
`release` job, so the site deploys only after the
release is frozen. `pages.yml` runs in the
`github-pages` environment, not the `release` one.

`pages.yml` calls `mdsmith-release build-website
--no-fix ./docs ./website/content/docs`. That snapshots
the source-of-truth `docs/` tree into the Hugo content
tree. `--no-fix` is used because `docs/` is already
lint-clean on main; CI must not mutate it. It resolves
the version to stamp from the caller input (a tool
release) or the latest `v*` tag (a docs-only push).

## OIDC Trusted Publishing

npm and PyPI accept the workflow's GitHub OIDC token
in place of a long-lived API token. The OIDC token
embeds claims describing the workflow run; the
registry-side Trusted Publisher config decides which
claim combinations are allowed to publish.

**npm Trusted Publisher** — configure at
`https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/access` for
every package listed in
[the npm channel doc](release-channels/npm.md).
That page is the canonical list. This doc does
not duplicate it.

| Field       | Value                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Repository  | `jeduden/mdsmith`              |
| Workflow    | `release.yml`                  |
| Environment | `release`                      |
| Ref         | `refs/heads/<selected-branch>` |

The OIDC `ref` claim follows the selected branch —
normally `refs/heads/main`. The `release` environment
restricts deploys to `main`. Publishing jobs cannot
acquire credentials from another branch. Set the
Trusted Publisher `ref` row to match.

Packages that do not exist yet are configured as
[pending publishers](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers)
at `https://www.npmjs.com/settings/<user>/trusted-publishers`
before the first publish.

**PyPI Trusted Publisher** — configure at
<https://pypi.org/manage/project/mdsmith/settings/publishing/>:

| Field             | Value             |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| GitHub Repository | `jeduden/mdsmith` |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml`     |
| Environment       | `release`         |

**npm 11.5+ requirement.** Older npm CLIs fall back
to token auth and the registry returns 404 instead
of 401 (so package existence is not leaked) when no
token is present. `release.yml` pins Node 24 (which
ships npm 11.x) and adds an explicit version guard
that fails the job if `npm --version` is below 11.5.

**2FA-required publishing.** Configure at the org
level once for each package:

```bash
npm access 2fa-required @mdsmith/cli
# repeat for each platform package
```

Trusted Publishing satisfies the 2FA requirement
because the OIDC token already proves the workflow's
identity.

## The `release` GitHub Environment

Every job that holds a publishing credential — `npm`,
`pypi`, `vscode`, `release` — declares
`environment: release`. The `environment` claim then
appears in the OIDC token and is pinned by the npm
and PyPI Trusted Publisher configs above.

Configure the environment at
<https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/settings/environments>:

| Setting                      | Value                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Required reviewers           | jeduden                             |
| Wait timer                   | 5 minutes (cancellation window)     |
| Deployment branches and tags | Selected — protected branch: `main` |

Without these protections the `environment` claim is
purely decorative. The Trusted Publishers reject any
workflow run whose claim set does not include
`environment=release`, so the env must exist before
the first release.

## Long-Lived Publisher Tokens

Long-lived publisher tokens (gated by the `release`
environment when applicable, plain repo secret
otherwise) are listed in
[secret-rotations.md](secret-rotations.md). That
page holds the rotation procedure plus a catalog
over per-secret files in
[`secret-rotations/`](secret-rotations/), one file
per tracked secret. A scheduled workflow opens an
issue 30 days before any tracked secret is due.

## Supply-Chain Hardening

The release pipeline applies the following controls.
Each item is enforced by the workflow file, the npm
manifest, or a CI guard — convention alone is not
enough.

- **OIDC Trusted Publishing** for npm and PyPI — no
  long-lived registry tokens stored as repo secrets.
- **SLSA build provenance attestations** via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance` for every binary
  and the `.vsix`. Each attestation ties the file's
  SHA-256 to this workflow run and the commit it was
  built from.
- **Sigstore keyless signatures** (cosign 3.x with
  `--bundle`) on `checksums.txt`. The signing
  certificate's subject is the `release.yml` workflow
  on this repository for the dispatched run.
- **`release` GitHub environment** gating every
  publishing job behind required-reviewer rules.
- **`if: github.repository == 'jeduden/mdsmith'`** on
  every publishing job, so a fork-cloned release
  workflow cannot reach the publish steps.
- **`concurrency: { group: release }`** (tag-agnostic)
  to serialize every release run, so no two publish
  jobs can race the registry at the same time.
- **Pinned third-party action SHAs** so a tag move
  on an upstream action cannot silently inject
  behavior.
- **`persist-credentials: false`** on every
  `actions/checkout` (except the demo asset push,
  which only writes to the orphan `assets` branch).
- **`cache: false` / `no-cache: true`** in the
  release path. The GitHub Actions tool cache is the
  fork-base trust boundary the TanStack worm
  exploited; the release path does not restore from
  it.
- **`bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`**
  for every VS Code extension install. Lifecycle
  hooks from dev dependencies are the install-time
  code-execution path the shai-hulud / TanStack worm
  class relies on.
- **`npm-lifecycle-guard` CI job** rejects any PR
  adding an install-, uninstall-, prepare-, pack-,
  or publish-time lifecycle hook to the published
  manifests. The `banned=` line in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the canonical list.
- **zizmor self-audit** of every workflow in CI,
  failing the job on any finding.
- **No `pull_request_target`, no `workflow_run`, no
  `actions/github-script`, no `github:owner/repo#sha`
  git URL dependencies** — the four upstream surfaces
  most often abused by the shai-hulud worm class do
  not exist in this repo.
- **CODEOWNERS** requires owner review on every file
  under `.github/workflows/` and on this document.

The [hardening note](../security/2026-05-12-supply-chain-hardening.md)
walks through the above against the TanStack /
mini-shai-hulud attack chain.

## Operational Checklist

Run this list once when bootstrapping a fresh clone
or after rotating credentials. Each item below is a
configuration the workflow assumes is already in
place.

1. [ ] Create the `release` environment at
   <https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/settings/environments>
   with the values in the table above.
2. [ ] Add the npm Trusted Publisher to every
   published package with `environment=release` and
   `ref=refs/heads/main` (see the npm Trusted
   Publisher section above for the package list).
3. [ ] Add the PyPI Trusted Publisher with the same
   environment scope.
4. [ ] Enable `2fa-required` on every npm package.
5. [ ] Store `VSCE_PAT` and `OVSX_PAT` as repo
   secrets scoped to the `release` environment.
6. [ ] Enable branch protection on `main` requiring
   CODEOWNERS review for the paths in
   `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
7. [ ] Keep the `release` environment's required
   reviewer set: it is the only release gate, since
   the workflow (not a maintainer) creates the tag.

## Verifying a Released Artifact

End-user verification is documented in the
[installation guide](../guides/install.md#github-release-direct-download).
It covers `cosign verify-blob`, `gh attestation
verify`, and `sha256sum -c`. Each step resolves
through the workflow's GitHub OIDC identity. A
forged binary or rewritten checksums file fails
verification unless the attacker also controls
`release.yml` on this repository.
