title: PR Fixup Workflow
summary: PR fixup workflow for rebase, CI monitoring, review comment resolution, and gh CLI setup.
---

Push changes, monitor CI, and address review comments
until the PR is clean. Run this workflow after creating
or updating a PR, or when CI fails or reviewers leave
comments.

## Prerequisites

- Git configured with push access to the remote
- `gh` CLI authenticated with repo access (step 1
  installs it if missing)
- Run each code block as its own Bash call — do not
  chain with `&&` or prefix with inline variable
  assignments (`VAR=x cmd`). Permission patterns match
  on the command prefix, so `gh api ...` must be the
  first token in the command

## Steps

### 1. Ensure `gh` CLI is installed

```bash
gh pr --help
```

If missing, install from
[cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com):

```bash
brew install gh
```

If `brew` is unavailable, download the release tarball
from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases).
If not authenticated, run `gh auth login` or set
`GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### 2. Identify the PR

Store the PR number, branch, and repo name for later
steps. Run each command separately:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

Note the number as `$PR`. Then:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Note the branch as `$BRANCH`. Then:

```bash
gh pr view --json headRepository \
  -q '.headRepository.owner.login + "/" + .headRepository.name'
```

Note the repo as `$REPO`.

### 3. Rebase onto the base branch

```bash
gh pr view --json baseRefName -q '.baseRefName'
```

Note the base branch as `$BASE`. Then:

```bash
git fetch origin "$BASE"
```

```bash
git rebase "origin/$BASE"
```

If the rebase produces conflicts, resolve them, then
continue:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

After a successful rebase, verify linting still passes:

```bash
go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .
```

### 4. Push changes

After a rebase, a force push is required (subsequent
pushes after CI/review fixes can use a regular push):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin "$BRANCH"
```

### 5. Poll CI checks until they finish

Always use the `--watch` flag — it is a single command
that matches permission patterns and blocks until all
checks complete:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR" --watch --fail-fast
```

If `--watch` is unavailable (older `gh` versions or web
sandbox), poll manually with repeated single calls:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR" --json name,state
```

Re-run the command every 30 seconds until all checks
reach `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `ERROR`.

### 6. On CI failure — diagnose and fix

Fetch the failed job log:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR" --json name,state,conclusion \
  -q '.[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE")'
```

Get the run ID of the most recent failure:

```bash
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" \
  --status failure --limit 1 \
  --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId'
```

Note the run ID as `$RUN_ID`. Then download the log:

```bash
gh run view "$RUN_ID" --log-failed
```

Read the log, identify the root cause, fix the code,
then:

```bash
git add -A
```

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address CI failure"
```

```bash
git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

Return to step 5.

### 7. Fetch review threads

Fetch all review threads with their comments, paths,
and resolution status in a single GraphQL call:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              body
              author { login }
              path
              line
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="${REPO%%/*}" -f repo="${REPO##*/}" \
   -F pr="$PR"
```

Returns the first 100 threads (10 comments each).
Paginate with `pageInfo` if the PR exceeds this.

### 8. Address each comment

For every unresolved review thread:

1. Read the comment body and file path.
2. Make the requested change (or explain why not).
3. Reply to the thread:

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments" \
  -f body="Fixed — see latest push." \
  -F in_reply_to=COMMENT_ID
```

4. Resolve the thread:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($threadId: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
    thread { id isResolved }
  }
}' -f threadId="THREAD_NODE_ID"
```

### 9. Push fixes and repeat

```bash
git add -A
```

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
```

```bash
git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

Return to step 5 and repeat until all CI checks pass
and no unresolved threads remain.

### 10. Final verification

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR"
```

Re-run the step 7 query and filter for unresolved
threads. If the count is 0 and CI is green, the PR is
ready for merge.

## Notes

- This workflow works in both local environments and
  Claude Code web sandbox. Step 1 installs `gh` if
  missing.
- Always run `mdsmith check .` before committing to
  catch linting issues early.
- Keep fix commits small and focused — one commit per
  CI fix, one commit per batch of related review
  comments.
- Use `--force-with-lease` only after rebase (step 3).
  After that, append fix commits with regular pushes so
  reviewers can see incremental progress.

Once the unresolved count is 0 and CI is green, the PR
is ready for merge.
