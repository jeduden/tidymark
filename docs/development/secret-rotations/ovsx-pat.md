# OVSX_PAT

Sign in to
[open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens](https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens)
(authentication goes through GitHub OAuth) and
generate a token scoped to the `jeduden` namespace.
Open VSX does not force expiry, so the only deadline
is the local cadence in `periodDays`.

Store the value as the `OVSX_PAT` secret on the
`release` GitHub environment.
