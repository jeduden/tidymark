# TypeScript architecture patterns

Guidance for the VS Code extension at
`editors/vscode/`. See the
[architecture hub](index.md) for the
cross-cutting principles; this page covers
how to apply each in TypeScript within the
extension's bounds.

Where this page describes a layout or
flow, treat it as the target state the
extension is converging on, not always
the current snapshot. Sections that
describe the gap are called out
explicitly.

## Layout

The extension is intentionally small and
should stay small. The target shape:

```text
editors/vscode/src/
├── extension.ts        (thin entry;
│                        delegates to
│                        wiring.ts)
├── wiring.ts           (compose commands +
│                        LSP client)
├── binary.ts           (locate mdsmith
│                        binary)
└── commands/
    ├── init.ts
    ├── kinds.ts
    ├── fix-workspace.ts
    ├── merge-driver.ts
    ├── runner.ts       (typed exec of
    │                    binary subcommands)
    └── virtual-doc.ts
```

Tests live next to source as `*.test.ts`.

**Current vs target**: today
`extension.ts` also runs the LSP client.
It watches the config file. It calls
`vscode.commands.registerCommand` directly
(see `registerPaletteCommands`). That
work should move to `wiring.ts` and
`commands/*`. Do not grow `extension.ts`
further. Add new code where the target
shape places it.

## Single responsibility per module

Each `commands/<name>.ts` holds one command.
Shared steps live in `commands/runner.ts`.
Today it owns subprocess spawn and returns
typed `{stdout, stderr, exitCode}` results.
Target: parse those results into typed
domain shapes that commands consume. Do not
copy spawn logic into each command.

A command past ~200 lines should split. Pick
three modules. One picks the args. One runs
the call. One shows the result.

## Open/closed: adding a command

Target: a new command should be added
without modifying `extension.ts`. Steps:

1. Create `commands/<name>.ts` exporting a
   registration function.
2. Wire it from `wiring.ts`.
3. Add `commands/<name>.test.ts` alongside.
4. Add the matching entry to the
   `contributes.commands` section of
   `package.json`.

**Current state**: commands register in
`extension.ts` today. The helper is
`registerPaletteCommands`. Add new
entries there. Move that helper to
`wiring.ts` later. Keep `activate` thin:
delegate registration to a helper instead
of inlining `vscode.commands.registerCommand`
calls in the activation body.

The `contributes` section of `package.json`
is the public surface for VS Code commands
and configuration. Treat it as part of the
contract; changing the id or arguments of a
shipped command is a breaking change.

## Liskov: commands are interchangeable

Every command takes the same wiring shape.
That shape is a typed dependency object or
`vscode.ExtensionContext`. Every command
returns `Promise<void>` or
`vscode.Disposable`.

Do not introduce optional, command-specific
parameters at the registration site. If a
command needs extra configuration, read it
from workspace settings inside the command.
Do not push it onto the caller.

A command must commit to one return shape.
"Maybe done, maybe not" violates Liskov. The
caller should not need to know which kind it
received.

## Interface segregation: the binary boundary

`binary.ts` exposes a small interface for
locating and invoking `mdsmith`. Functions
should be narrow:

- "Find the binary path" should not also
  "warm a cache of subcommand outputs".
- "Run `mdsmith kinds --json`" should not
  also "run `mdsmith fix .`".

Add a new function rather than widening an
existing one. Consumers should only import
the functions they need; tree-shaking is a
nice consequence of well-segregated
modules.

## Dependency inversion: prefer types

The extension communicates with the Go core
through three typed boundaries. Never
thread raw, unparsed values across them:

- **LSP protocol** — typed via
  `vscode-languageclient`. Capabilities are
  the contract; treat additions as additive
  and removals as breaking.
- **Subprocess invocation** of the
  `mdsmith` binary — typed by the JSON
  schema returned by each subcommand and
  parsed in `commands/runner.ts`.
- **File system reads** — typed via narrow
  shape interfaces (e.g. a parsed
  `.mdsmith.yml` shape, not raw YAML).

If `mdsmith kinds --json` returns a list,
parse it into a typed value in
`runner.ts`; consumers see the type, not
the raw JSON. The boundary between strings
and types should be exactly one function
deep.

## Clean architecture in extension.ts

Target: `extension.ts` should be wiring
only:

- Activate the extension.
- Construct the wiring object.
- Hand control to `wiring.ts`.

Today `extension.ts` also owns the LSP
client, a config-file watcher, and direct
command registrations. Those concerns are
scheduled to move into `wiring.ts` and
dedicated command modules. When adding
new code, do not extend the current
pattern — place it where the target shape
expects it.

## Testing patterns

- Pure unit tests for each module using the
  project's configured test runner (see
  `editors/vscode/package.json` →
  `scripts.test`).
- Extract pure functions out of command
  bodies and unit-test those instead of
  mocking `vscode`. Mock the `vscode` API
  only when unavoidable.
- For the binary boundary, prefer running
  the real binary against a fixture
  workspace over mocking subprocess calls.
- Place test fixtures under
  `editors/vscode/test-fixtures/` or
  alongside the test that uses them. Do
  not import fixture data across command
  modules.

## Common violations to flag

- A command that imports another command.
- A command that constructs paths to
  another command's artifacts (use
  `wiring.ts` to share state).
- A type declared in `extension.ts` that is
  used by commands — should live in
  `wiring.ts` or its own module.
- Raw `child_process.exec` outside
  `binary.ts` or `commands/runner.ts`.
- A field added to `package.json`
  `contributes` without a corresponding
  module that owns it.
- A test that spins up the full VS Code
  host to test logic that could be
  unit-tested out of band.
- A `vscode.commands.registerCommand` call
  in `extension.ts`.
- A `Util`, `Helpers`, or `Misc` module
  anywhere in `src/`.

## Match the npm shim

`npm/mdsmith/test/shim.test.ts` tests the
binary-launcher shim. The shim is the only
place that knows how to find and exec the
Go binary across platforms. The VS Code
extension's `binary.ts` should consume that
contract, not reimplement it. If the
extension needs platform-specific behavior
the shim does not provide, add the
behavior to the shim first.

## Refactor moves that usually work

- A command with three responsibilities →
  split into three commands or one command
  plus two helpers in `commands/runner.ts`.
- A growing `wiring.ts` → extract a
  registry module that commands enroll
  into; `wiring.ts` becomes a thin call
  list.
- Raw JSON crossing module boundaries →
  parse into a typed shape at the binary
  boundary and pass the shape onward.
- `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration` calls
  scattered through commands → centralize
  into a config-reader module typed to the
  `.mdsmith.yml` and `package.json`
  contributes schemas.
