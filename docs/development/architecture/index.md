# Architecture principles

How SOLID and clean architecture apply to
mdsmith's actual code. The
[solid-architecture skill](../../../.claude/skills/solid-architecture/SKILL.md)
holds the generic language patterns; this
hub names mdsmith's packages, layers, and
the concrete anti-patterns we have already
hit.

## The five SOLID principles in mdsmith

- **Single responsibility**: every package
  under `internal/` answers one question.
  `internal/lint` answers "does this file
  violate a rule?"; `internal/fix` answers
  "what edits make it stop violating?";
  `internal/linkgraph` answers "what's a
  Markdown link and what does it point
  at?". They read each other's outputs but
  never collapse.
- **Open/closed**: new rules and fixes are
  added by creating a Go package under
  `internal/rules/<rule-name>/` (e.g.
  `internal/rules/linelength/`) plus a
  matching docs+fixtures directory at
  `internal/rules/MDS###-<rule-name>/`
  (e.g. `internal/rules/MDS001-line-length/`).
  The blank-import barrel
  `internal/rules/all/all.go` wires every
  production rule. The engine never needs
  edits when a rule is added.
- **Liskov substitution**: every
  `rule.Rule` implementation must work in
  every engine call site. A rule that
  needs the engine to know its name (so
  the engine special-cases it) is a Liskov
  violation — widen the interface or push
  the special case down into a config
  filter.
- **Interface segregation**: `internal/rule`
  exposes small interfaces (`Rule`,
  `FixableRule`, `Configurable`,
  `Defaultable`, `ListMerger`,
  `ConfigTarget`). A rule only implements
  the slice of capabilities it needs.
- **Dependency inversion**: high-level
  packages depend on the small `rule`
  interface, not on concrete rule
  packages. The VS Code extension talks to
  the LSP server over the wire protocol,
  not to a Go type.

## Project layering

Go side. `cmd/mdsmith` and `internal/lsp`
are both top-layer entry points; both
depend on `internal/engine`, never the
reverse.

```text
cmd/mdsmith              internal/lsp
  (CLI entry)              (LSP entry)
        └───────┐    ┌──────┘
                ↓    ↓
        internal/engine      (orchestration)
              └─> internal/{rule, fix,
                            config, output,
                            lint, linkgraph,
                            index,
                            discovery,
                            schema, …}
                    └─> internal/{mdtext,
                                  globpath,
                                  yamlutil,
                                  log,
                                  fieldinterp,
                                  placeholders}
                        (helpers; deps among
                         siblings are
                         allowed, cycles are
                         not — e.g.
                         placeholders →
                         fieldinterp)
                    └─> pkg/markdown
                        (the one goldmark
                         parse/produce
                         surface; public,
                         imports no
                         internal/ package)
```

`pkg/markdown` sits at the bottom: the
parse path. `internal/lint` and
`internal/release` depend on it; it
depends on nothing in the tree. It is
also a public cross-system surface — see
[cross-system contracts](cross-system.md)
and [Public Markdown Library](../markdown-library.md).

Plus the rule plugins. Each rule has a Go
implementation package and a sibling
docs+fixtures directory:

```text
internal/rules/<rule-name>/         (Go pkg)
internal/rules/MDS###-<rule-name>/  (docs +
                                     good/,
                                     bad/)
  └─> internal/rule (interfaces only)
  └─> internal/mdtext (parse helpers)
  ✗ MUST NOT import internal/engine
  ✗ MUST NOT import another rule package
```

TypeScript side:

```text
editors/vscode/src/extension.ts   (entry)
  └─> wiring.ts                   (compose)
        └─> commands/*            (one each)
              └─> binary.ts       (find +
                                   exec)
              └─> commands/runner.ts
                                  (typed I/O
                                   to binary)
```

Cross-system contracts (LSP, CLI flags,
`.mdsmith.yml`, generated section markers,
plugin manifests, distribution shims) live
at the very edge. They are public APIs
under stricter compatibility rules. See
[cross-system contracts](cross-system.md).

## Test pyramid

Tests are part of the architecture.
mdsmith follows a four-layer pyramid
(unit, contract, integration, e2e)
and every function — exported and
unexported — ships with a dedicated
unit test. The canonical home is
[Test pyramid](tests.md); the
language pages bind the rule to
concrete file and symbol patterns.

## Anti-patterns we have actually hit

These are the patterns mdsmith audits have
caught and the reasons we reject them:

- **A new Go package named `util`,
  `common`, `helpers`, or `lib`.** The name
  answers no question, so the package
  attracts unrelated code.
- **A rule package importing another rule
  package.** Rules share helpers via
  `internal/mdtext` or
  `internal/rules/astutil`; reaching
  sideways into a sibling rule binds
  release cycles that should stay
  independent.
- **A Go or TypeScript command that
  parses Markdown inline** (a local
  `goldmark.New()`) instead of delegating
  to `pkg/markdown`. That pulls the
  parser config out of one place and into
  many — exactly the drift plan 163
  removed from `internal/release`.
- **A distribution shim (`npm/`,
  `python/`) that reimplements binary
  logic** instead of exec'ing it. Shims
  are Liskov substitutes for the binary;
  drift kills that property.
- **A `.mdsmith.yml` field consumed only
  inside one rule package** — promote it
  to that rule's settings or push the
  consumer back to where the data is
  owned, so the schema reflects ownership.
- **A test that mocks `rule.Rule`** instead
  of using a real Markdown fixture. Mocks
  at the boundary suggest the boundary is
  wrong; if the rule is hard to fixture-test,
  the rule's contract is too wide.
- **A TypeScript command that imports
  another command.** Commands share state
  through `wiring.ts`, not by reaching
  across.
- **A new public function in
  `internal/engine` whose only caller is
  one rule** — move it to `internal/rule`
  or `internal/mdtext`. Engine grows
  unbounded otherwise.
- **A new function landing without a
  dedicated unit test.** Either the
  function is too coupled to test in
  isolation (push it down to a port
  package so it can be tested) or the
  test was forgotten (write it). The
  audit flags uncovered functions as
  test debt.
- **An e2e test added where a unit
  test would do the same work.** E2E
  tests run the built binary; they
  are far slower than unit tests.
  Reserve them for full-binary
  behaviour the unit layer cannot
  reach.
