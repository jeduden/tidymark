## Build & Test Commands

Requires Go 1.24+.

- `go build ./...` — build all packages
- `go test ./...` — run all tests
- `go test -run TestName ./...` — run a specific test
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .` — lint markdown
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith fix .` — auto-fix markdown
- `go tool golangci-lint run` — run linter
- `go vet ./...` — run go vet

## Project Layout

Follow the [standard Go project
layout](https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout):

- `cmd/mdsmith/` — main application entry point
- `internal/` — private packages not importable by
  other modules
- `internal/rules/` — rule documentation
  (`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/README.md`)
- `testdata/` — test fixtures (markdown files for
  testing rules)

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, goimports)
- Use golangci-lint for linting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Error messages should be lowercase, no trailing
  punctuation
- Prefer returning errors over panicking

## Test Fixtures

Rule test fixtures live in
`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/`. Each rule has `good/` and
`bad/` examples (or `good.md` / `bad.md`).

Good fixtures must pass **all default-enabled rules**
plus the rule under test. Default-disabled (opt-in)
rules are skipped for other rules' fixtures: a
good fixture for MDS001 is not required to also
satisfy MDS043, since MDS043 is opt-in and would not
fire in a default project. When a good fixture uses
non-default settings (e.g. setext headings, tilde
fences), add a matching override in `.mdsmith.yml`
so that `mdsmith check .` also passes.

Bad fixtures are excluded via the `ignore:` section in
`.mdsmith.yml`.

When adding or changing a rule feature, add both:

1. **Unit tests** in `rule_test.go` (inline markdown,
   fast red/green cycle). Use `require` from testify
   for preconditions that abort the test and `assert`
   for checks that continue. Use `Same`/`NotSame` for
   pointer identity.
2. **Fixture tests** under `internal/rules/<id>-<name>/`
   (`good/` and `bad/` markdown files with YAML
   frontmatter specifying expected diagnostics). These
   are discovered automatically by the integration test
   runner in `internal/integration/rules_test.go`.

## Config Merge Semantics

Layered config (defaults → kinds → overrides) is
**deep-merged** rule by rule:

- Maps merge key by key; sibling settings set in earlier
  layers survive when a later layer touches only one key.
- Scalars at a leaf are replaced wholesale by the later
  layer.
- List-typed settings replace by default. A rule opts a
  particular list setting into `append` by implementing
  `rule.ListMerger.SettingMergeMode(key)` and returning
  `rule.MergeAppend`. The placeholder vocabulary
  (`placeholders:`) is the canonical append-mode setting.
- A bool-only layer (`rule-name: false`) toggles
  `enabled` without erasing inherited settings.

When adding a new list-typed setting, decide whether
it should `append` or `replace`. Document the choice
next to its `ApplySettings` handler.

## Generated Sections

Content between `<?directive ... ?>` and
`<?/directive?>` markers is auto-generated. Do not
edit the body by hand — edit the directive parameters
or the source file it references, then run
`mdsmith fix <file>` to regenerate.

After merge conflicts in generated sections, run
`mdsmith fix <file>` to regenerate. The
`merge-driver` command automates this:

```bash
mdsmith merge-driver install [files...]
```

Run `mdsmith merge-driver install` once per clone.
