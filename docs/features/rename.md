# Rename without breaking links

Renaming a heading normally breaks every
`[text](file.md#old-slug)` link that pointed at it. The
links still parse, so nothing complains until a reader hits
a dead anchor — or until MDS027 flags it on the next lint
pass, after the damage is committed.

mdsmith renames the whole graph at once. Rename a heading
and the editor rewrites the heading line plus every
workspace anchor link that resolved to its slug, in a
single atomic edit. Same-file `(#slug)` references are
included. When a duplicate-name disambiguator shifts —
renaming the first "Setup" changes the second's slug from
`setup-1` to `setup` — the affected links update too.

Link-reference labels rename the same way. The `[label]:
url` definition and every `[text][label]` and shortcut
`[label]` use in the file move together.

The rename refuses to corrupt the workspace. If the new
heading text slugifies to a slug another heading already
owns, the rename fails and names the colliding heading
rather than silently shifting numbered suffixes. A label
that collides with another definition fails the same way.
Text that slugifies to nothing, or that contains a newline
or a stray bracket, is rejected before any edit applies.

Any LSP-aware editor, and the Claude Code agent, can
drive this over the wire. See the
[LSP reference](../reference/cli/lsp.md) for the
prepare-range table and the collision-error contract.

## From the command line

The same rename engine has a CLI surface, so a script or
an agent with no editor reaches it too:

```bash
mdsmith rename docs/guide.md --heading "Old Title" "New Title"
mdsmith rename docs/guide.md --link-ref oldlabel newlabel
```

`--heading` matches the heading's current visible text;
`--link-ref` matches the label. The command rewrites
every dependent edit in place and prints a per-file
summary (`--format text|json`). A collision, an empty or
bracket-bearing name, or a missing target exits non-zero
and names the conflict, exactly like the editor path. See
the [`mdsmith rename` reference](../reference/cli/rename.md)
for flags, output, and exit codes.
