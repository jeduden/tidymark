# Self-maintaining sections

Some sections should never be hand-edited. mdsmith marks them
with directives and rebuilds the body on `mdsmith fix`.

`<?toc?>` rebuilds a heading table of contents. `<?catalog?>`
generates an index — a list, a table, or any row template — from
the front matter of files matching a glob. `<?include?>` splices
in another file.

Generated blocks fight Git merges. `mdsmith merge-driver install`
registers a driver for them. It re-runs the directive and resolves
the conflict for you.

See the [generating-content
guide](../guides/directives/generating-content.md) for directive
syntax and options.
