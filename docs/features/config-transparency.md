# Config you can explain

Four config layers stack on every rule. When a rule fires, the
question is which layer set the value that triggered it — mdsmith
answers that per leaf.

Config resolves in order: defaults, then convention, then kinds,
then per-glob overrides. The merge is rule by rule. Maps merge
key by key, so a later layer that touches one setting does not
erase its siblings. Scalars replace; lists replace unless a rule
opts a setting into append.

`check --explain` attaches provenance to every diagnostic.
`mdsmith kinds resolve <file>` prints the effective config with
per-leaf provenance, and `kinds why <file> <rule>` shows the full
merge chain including no-op layers.

See the [kinds reference](../reference/cli/kinds.md) and the
[CLI reference](../reference/cli.md) for merge semantics.
