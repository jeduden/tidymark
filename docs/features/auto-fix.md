# Auto-fix Markdown formatting

`mdsmith fix` is the write side of the linter. It rewrites
trailing whitespace, heading style, code-fence delimiters, bare
URLs, list indentation, and table alignment directly in the file.

The fixer runs as a fixed-point loop: it applies every fixable
rule, re-parses, and repeats until the document stops changing or
it has run ten passes. Stabilization means one fix never undoes
another.

`mdsmith check` runs the same rules without writing. It is the
read-only sibling for CI, returning a non-zero exit code when any
rule fails so a pipeline can block the merge.

See the [`fix`](../reference/cli/fix.md) and
[`check`](../reference/cli/check.md) command references for flags
and exit codes.
