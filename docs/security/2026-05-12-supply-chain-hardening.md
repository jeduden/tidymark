  Threat-model review against the TanStack / mini-shai-hulud npm
  worm (2026-05-11), followed by gap fixes in release.yml, ci.yml,
  and SECURITY.md.
title: Supply-Chain Hardening — mini-shai-hulud / TanStack Class
summary: >-
  Confirms mdsmith is not vulnerable to the direct TanStack attack
  chain (pull_request_target pwn, fork-network orphan-commit OIDC
  abuse, runtime memory extraction of publish tokens). Adds
  defense-in-depth controls: concurrency group, repository-and-
  environment guards on publishing jobs, `--ignore-scripts` on every
  `bun install`, a CI guard that fails any future PR introducing npm
  lifecycle hooks, and centralizes the release pipeline documentation.

# Security Review: mini-shai-hulud / TanStack Supply-Chain Class

The steady-state release pipeline and the full list
of supply-chain controls live in
[`docs/development/release.md`](../development/release.md).
This note is a point-in-time threat model: what the
attack was, which surfaces it touched in mdsmith, and
which gaps the 2026-05-12 commit closed.

## Background

On 2026-05-11 between 19:20 and 19:26 UTC an attacker
published 84 malicious versions across 42
`@tanstack/*` npm packages. The same worm family also
hit `@mistralai/*`, `@uipath/*`, `@squawk/*`, and
others. The [Aikido write-up][aikido] and the
[TanStack postmortem][tanstack-post] (linked from
[tanstack/router#7383][router-issue]) describe a
three-stage chain:

1. **`pull_request_target` "Pwn Request"** — a fork
   PR triggered a workflow that checked out and
   executed the fork's code with access to base-repo
   secrets.
2. **GitHub Actions cache poisoning across the
   fork↔base trust boundary** — the malicious fork
   wrote a poisoned pnpm store into the shared
   cache; the legitimate release workflow restored
   that cache.
3. **Runtime OIDC token extraction** — the malware
   located the `Runner.Worker` process, read
   `/proc/<pid>/maps` and `/proc/<pid>/mem`, and
   pulled the GitHub Actions OIDC token from memory.
   Because TanStack's npm Trusted Publisher was
   scoped at the repository level (not pinned to a
   protected branch / ref / workflow file /
   environment), the stolen token minted a valid
   short-lived npm publish credential. The worm
   published [validly-attested SLSA Build Level 3
   provenance for malicious packages][ghsa].

A parallel vector used by other mini-shai-hulud
waves is the classic `preinstall` / `postinstall`
lifecycle script that scans the install host for npm
tokens, GitHub PATs, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, SSH
keys, and cloud credentials. The worm then
republishes infected versions of every package the
stolen npm token can write.

## Why mdsmith Is Not Directly Vulnerable

Reviewing the exact TanStack attack chain step by
step:

1. **No `pull_request_target` trigger anywhere** —
   `grep -rn 'pull_request_target' .github/` returns
   no hits. Fork PRs cannot execute privileged
   workflows.
2. **No `workflow_run` trigger** — eliminates the
   secondary chained-workflow vector other shai-
   hulud waves used.
3. **No `actions/github-script` step** — no surface
   for inline JavaScript that runs with the
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` of a fork PR.
4. **No `github:owner/repo#sha` git URL
   dependencies** — `grep -rn '"github:' npm/
   editors/` is empty, so the fork-network orphan-
   commit specifier vector cannot reach mdsmith's
   installable surface.
5. **GitHub Actions tool cache disabled in the
   release workflow** — `setup-go` is invoked with
   `cache: false` and `setup-bun` with
   `no-cache: true`. The release path cannot restore
   a poisoned cache.
6. **No `preinstall` / `postinstall` / `install`
   lifecycle hooks** in any published manifest. The
   npm shim deliberately resolves the platform
   binary at runtime, not at install time. The
   `npm-lifecycle-guard` CI job now enforces this in
   CI rather than relying on convention.
7. **npm publishing uses Trusted Publishing
   (OIDC)** — no long-lived `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` for a
   worm to harvest from `~/.npmrc` or env vars.
8. **PyPI publishing uses Trusted Publishing
   (OIDC)** — same property.
9. **All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to
   commit SHAs** — a tag move on
   `softprops/action-gh-release`, `actions/checkout`,
   `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`, or
   `codecov/codecov-action` cannot silently pull a
   malicious version.
10. **zizmor runs in CI and fails the job on any
    finding** — the same scanner that flagged the
    TanStack cache-poisoning surface.

## Defense-in-Depth Hardening Applied 2026-05-12

The above leaves four residual concerns. The
2026-05-12 commit closes them and centralizes the
ongoing posture in
[`docs/development/release.md`](../development/release.md).

### 1. OIDC token scope was workflow-file-only

The npm Trusted Publisher was configured to require
`repo=jeduden/mdsmith` and `workflow=release.yml`.
That is strictly better than the TanStack baseline.
A successful `release.yml` run on any ref could
still mint a publish token. Adding
`environment: release` to every job that holds
`id-token: write` (or a long-lived publisher PAT)
introduces an `environment` claim in the OIDC token.
With the environment claim required at the npm /
PyPI side, an attacker who somehow runs `release.yml`
outside the `release` environment cannot mint a valid
publish token. The
[release pipeline operational checklist](../development/release.md#operational-checklist)
lists the corresponding npmjs.com, pypi.org, and
GitHub UI steps.

### 2. Concurrent tag pushes could race the publish window

A second `git push --tags` while a release was in
flight previously ran the publish jobs in parallel
against the same registry record. The new
`concurrency: { group: release, cancel-in-progress: false }`
at the workflow level serializes every release run
— tag-agnostic, so different tags pushed back-to-back
queue rather than overlap. The first publish
completes; the second runs after.

### 3. Lifecycle scripts of dev-time dependencies could run during CI

The VS Code extension's dev dependency tree
(`@vscode/vsce`, `typescript`, `@types/*`,
`vscode-languageclient`) is pure-JS today. A future
lockfile update or registry compromise could
introduce a `postinstall` hook. Every
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` invocation now also
passes `--ignore-scripts`, neutralizing the install-
time code execution path the shai-hulud worm relies
on. If a future dep genuinely needs a lifecycle
script, the requirement should be documented here
before the flag is relaxed for that step.

### 4. CI guard against future manifest tampering

`ci.yml`'s new `npm-lifecycle-guard` job rejects any
PR that adds `preinstall` / `install` / `postinstall`
/ `prepare` / `uninstall` hooks to
`npm/mdsmith/package.json` or
`editors/vscode/package.json`. The guard is
intentionally noisy: changing it requires updating
this security note.

## Residual Risk

- **Long-lived `VSCE_PAT` / `OVSX_PAT` /
  `MERGE_QUEUE_TOKEN`** are still long-lived PATs.
  The `release` environment gates them behind
  reviewers; rotate annually (calendar reminders
  live in `CLAUDE.md`).
- **`codecov-action` with `id-token: write` runs on
  PRs from same-repo branches.** The OIDC token's
  audience is `codecov`, so it cannot be replayed
  against npm or PyPI. The upload step is `if`-gated
  to skip fork PRs.
- **Lockfiles are not verified against a content-
  addressed registry.** `bun audit signatures` would
  catch a registry-side tampering; future work.
