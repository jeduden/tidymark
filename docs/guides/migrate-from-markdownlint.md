title: Migrating from markdownlint
summary: >-
  Move a project from markdownlint-cli or markdownlint-cli2
  to mdsmith — the rule mapping, the config rewrite, and
  the markdownlint rules mdsmith does not implement yet.

# Migrating from markdownlint

mdsmith covers most of the markdownlint rule set under
different IDs. The CLI shape is similar (`mdsmith check
.` mirrors `markdownlint .`), the auto-fix story is
strictly broader, and the config moves from
`.markdownlint.yaml` to `.mdsmith.yml`. This guide is
the on-ramp.

## What stays the same

- Per-file Markdown style checks (heading style,
  line-length, list indent, fenced-code style, etc.).
- Run in CI with a non-zero exit code on violations.
- Per-rule disable via config.

## What changes

- Rule IDs are `MDSxxx`, not `MDxxx`. The
  [linter comparison](../background/markdown-linters.md)
  documents rule-for-rule coverage.
- mdsmith adds cross-file integrity, generated sections,
  file kinds, and readability budgets that markdownlint
  does not have.
- Config lives in `.mdsmith.yml` with deep-merged layers
  (defaults → convention → kinds → overrides) rather
  than the flat markdownlint JSON / YAML.

## Convert `.markdownlint.yaml`

A typical markdownlint config looks like:

```yaml
default: true
MD013:
  line_length: 100
MD024:
  siblings_only: true
MD033: false
```

The equivalent `.mdsmith.yml`:

```yaml
rules:
  line-length:
    max: 100
  no-duplicate-headings:
    siblings-only: true
  no-inline-html: false
```

Rule names use kebab-case in mdsmith. Run `mdsmith init`
to scaffold a starting config with the defaults
expanded; then trim it to only the rules you want to
override.

for the full coverage table and the rules that have no
mdsmith equivalent yet.

## Run both in parallel for one PR

Keep your existing `.markdownlint.yaml` in place. Add
the mdsmith CI job. Compare reports on a representative
PR. Once mdsmith reports a strict superset of the
violations you care about, retire the markdownlint job.

```yaml
- name: mdsmith
  run: |
    go install github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/cmd/mdsmith@latest
    mdsmith check .
```
