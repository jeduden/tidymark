  Every channel that ships the mdsmith binary, the VS
  Code extension, or the Claude Code plugin — npm,
  PyPI, asdf, mise, the GitHub release, the Visual
  Studio Marketplace plus Open VSX, and the

# Installation

Each `vX.Y.Z` git tag ships the same Go binary through
several channels. `mdsmith version` reports the same
value on every channel because the version is stamped
into the binary at build time. Pick one path:

| Channel              | Command                                                                                             | Best for                                                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Go                   | `go install github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/cmd/mdsmith@latest`                                          | Go developers with a working Go toolchain                               |
| npm                  | `npm install -g @mdsmith/cli`                                                                       | Node / TypeScript repos and npm-friendly CI                             |
| npx                  | `npx @mdsmith/cli check .`                                                                          | One-off checks without a global install                                 |
| PyPI (pip)           | `pip install mdsmith`                                                                               | Python projects and Python-only CI images                               |
| uvx                  | `uvx mdsmith check .`                                                                               | Ephemeral runs via uv                                                   |
| pipx                 | `pipx install mdsmith`                                                                              | Isolated CLI install on Python hosts                                    |
| mise (`ubi` backend) | `mise use -g ubi:jeduden/mdsmith@latest`                                                            | Repos using mise; works today via GitHub releases without a registry PR |
| GitHub release       | Download `mdsmith-<os>-<arch>` from the [release page](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/releases) | Air-gapped hosts and direct binary control                              |

asdf and the short `mise use mdsmith@latest` form depend on
follow-up registry submissions tracked in
[plan/145](../../plan/145_asdf-mise-registry-submissions.md); the
sections below explain how to use each one once those land.

The binary ships for linux x86_64, linux aarch64, macOS
x86_64, macOS arm64, and Windows amd64. Other targets
require a Go toolchain.

## npm

```bash
npm install -g @mdsmith/cli
mdsmith version
```

The npm root is published as `@mdsmith/cli` (the
unscoped `mdsmith` name on npm is owned by another
project; we use the `@mdsmith` scope we own
instead). The installed binary is still called
`mdsmith` because the package's `bin` field maps
the command to a small Node.js shim.

The shim declares `optionalDependencies` for one
platform sub-package per supported host
(`@mdsmith/linux-x64`, `@mdsmith/linux-arm64`,
`@mdsmith/darwin-x64`, `@mdsmith/darwin-arm64`,
`@mdsmith/win32-x64`); npm installs only the one
that matches `process.platform` and `process.arch`.
There is no `postinstall` hook, so `npm install`
works in offline / air-gapped CI and on hosts that
ban network calls during install.

`npx @mdsmith/cli` and `pnpm dlx @mdsmith/cli` work
the same way without a permanent install.

## PyPI (pip / uvx / pipx)

```bash
pip install mdsmith
mdsmith version
```

```bash
uvx mdsmith check .
```

The PyPI release ships one platform-tagged wheel per
supported host. Each wheel bundles the prebuilt
binary under `mdsmith/_bin/` and exposes an `mdsmith`
console script that runs the binary in place: `os.execv`
on POSIX (so signals and exit codes pass through
unchanged) and `subprocess.run` on Windows, which has
no `execv` semantics. `pip`, `uv pip`, `pipx`, `uvx`,
and `python -m mdsmith` all work.

## asdf

> **Pending follow-up.** The `jeduden/asdf-mdsmith` plugin repo is
> a follow-up tracked in
> [plan/145](../../plan/145_asdf-mise-registry-submissions.md).
> Until that repo exists, the commands below will not resolve.
> Use one of the channels above in the meantime.

Once the plugin repo is published:

```bash
asdf plugin add mdsmith https://github.com/jeduden/asdf-mdsmith.git
asdf install mdsmith latest
asdf set mdsmith latest
mdsmith version
```

Once the plugin is also listed in
[`asdf-vm/asdf-plugins`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins),
the explicit URL becomes optional:
`asdf plugin add mdsmith` resolves on its own.

## mise

```bash
mise use -g ubi:jeduden/mdsmith@latest
mdsmith version
```

mise's `ubi` backend reads our GitHub release assets directly, so
this command works today without any registry submission. Once
the registry PR for mdsmith merges into
[`mise-plugins/registry`](https://github.com/mise-plugins/registry),
the shorter form

```bash
mise use mdsmith@latest
```

resolves on its own.

## GitHub release (direct download)

The [release page](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/releases)
attaches one binary per platform and a
`checksums.txt`. Download, verify the SHA-256, and
move the binary onto `$PATH`:

```bash
base="https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/releases/latest/download"
curl -L -o mdsmith-linux-amd64 "$base/mdsmith-linux-amd64"
curl -L -o checksums.txt       "$base/checksums.txt"
sha256sum -c <(grep mdsmith-linux-amd64 checksums.txt)
install -m 0755 mdsmith-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mdsmith
```

Keep the binary saved under its release-asset name
(`mdsmith-linux-amd64`) until verification is done —
both `sha256sum -c` and `gh attestation verify` below
match local files against that exact name. `install`
copies the file rather than moving it, so the original
remains for the verification steps.

For supply-chain-sensitive deployments, the release
also ships a SLSA build provenance attestation per
binary and a Sigstore signature on `checksums.txt`.
Verify the provenance with `gh`:

```bash
gh attestation verify mdsmith-linux-amd64 \
  -R jeduden/mdsmith
```

Verify the checksums-file signature with `cosign`
(requires cosign v3.0.0 or newer — earlier versions
do not accept `verify-blob --bundle`; check yours
with `cosign version`):

```bash
curl -L -o checksums.txt.bundle "$base/checksums.txt.bundle"
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity-regexp \
    "^https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/.github/workflows/release.yml@" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer \
    https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  checksums.txt
```

Both verifications resolve through the workflow's
GitHub OIDC identity, so a forged binary or rewritten
checksums file fails verification unless the attacker
also controls `release.yml` on `jeduden/mdsmith`.

This path is also the documented fallback if any of
the package channels above is unavailable on a given
day.

## VS Code extension

The extension talks to the Go binary over LSP. Install
the binary by one of the channels above, then add the
extension:

- **Visual Studio Marketplace** (stock VS Code, GitHub
  Codespaces, GitHub.dev): search for `jeduden.mdsmith`
  in the Extensions view, or run
  `code --install-extension jeduden.mdsmith`.
- **Open VSX** (VSCodium, Cursor, Theia, Gitpod):
  install from the marketplace UI, or run
  `codium --install-extension jeduden.mdsmith`.
- **GitHub release**: download the `.vsix` from the
  release page and run
  `code --install-extension mdsmith-X.Y.Z.vsix`.

The Marketplace, Open VSX, and GitHub-release `.vsix`
have identical SHA-256 sums; they're the same
artifact uploaded to three places.

See [VS Code Integration](editors/vscode.md) for the
configuration surface (`mdsmith.path`, `mdsmith.run`,
`mdsmith.fixOnSave`, `mdsmith.trace.server`).

## Claude Code plugin

The Claude Code plugin runs
`npx -y -p @mdsmith/cli mdsmith lsp`. The agent
receives Markdown diagnostics inline after every
edit. It also gains definition, references,
symbol search, and call-hierarchy queries across
the docs. Register the marketplace and install
the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jeduden/mdsmith
/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith
/reload-plugins
```

`npx` ships with Node.js, which Claude Code already
requires. First launch downloads `@mdsmith/cli` and
the platform binary subpackage from npm; later
launches reuse the npm cache. No global `mdsmith`
install is needed. To pin a specific build, install
the binary via any of the channels above.

If the `/plugin` Errors tab shows `Executable not
found in $PATH`, Node.js is missing from the shell
`$PATH` Claude Code sees. Install Node 20 LTS or
later, then run `/reload-plugins`.

See the
[Claude Code editor README](../../editors/claude-code/README.md)
for the install commands and troubleshooting steps.
