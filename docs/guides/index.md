Run both in a single pre-commit hook with the order Prettier last.                                                                                                          |
| [Coexist with Vale and remark](coexist-with-vale-and-remark.md)                     | Vale owns brand voice and prose style; remark owns Markdown AST transformations; mdsmith owns formatting, cross-file integrity, and generated sections.

| [Migrating from markdownlint](migrate-from-markdownlint.md)                         | Move a project from markdownlint-cli or markdownlint-cli2 to mdsmith — the rule mapping, the config rewrite, and the markdownlint rules mdsmith does not implement yet.                                                                                                               |
