title: External build orchestrator spike — Go-only
description: Whether mdsmith should outsource its build engine to
  an existing Go-based orchestrator instead of implementing the
  internal engine described in plans 102-117.
---
# External build orchestrator spike — Go-only

## Scope

mdsmith's `<?build?>` directive turns Markdown into a build
graph: every directive declares `inputs`, `outputs`, and a
recipe. The current plan set (102, 103, 115, 116, 117)
implements an internal engine for this graph: ActionID
content-hash cache, atomic multi-output write, trust gate,
hermetic execution environment, stdout/stderr capture, log
retention, parallel execution.

That is roughly 1 500 lines of plan describing several
hundred lines of Go.

This spike asks: instead of writing all that, can we lean on
an existing Go-based build orchestrator? mdsmith would
expose subcommands the orchestrator drives. The orchestrator
would own staleness, parallelism, and execution.

The spike was constrained to Go-language tools so the
mdsmith user does not have to install a foreign-language
runtime. A separate spike
([language-relaxed.md](language-relaxed.md)) revisits this
constraint.

## Verdict

Stick with the internal engine. Add a single side door.

No Go-native orchestrator offers a meaningfully better deal
than what plans 102-117 already specify. The closest
single-binary candidate (go-task) matches at the surface but
not on the threat model: it has no per-config trust gate, no
hermetic environment, no atomic multi-output write, no
output-confinement post-conditions, and its checksum scope
excludes `generates` (see [go-task issue #238][issue-238]).
Outsourcing the engine moves four of the five gotchas from
the
[gotchas spike](#gotchas-summary) back onto the user.

Recommendation: keep the internal engine; add one new
subcommand (`mdsmith targets --json`) that lets users who
already drive cross-tool DAGs with go-task / make / just
fold mdsmith into their outer orchestration.

### Why each was rejected as the primary engine

- **n2** — Rust, not Go; the [README][n2] explicitly calls
  it hobbyist code from a single author.
- **bob** — last commit March 2024; not a safe runtime
  dependency for a tool we are still planning.
- **please** — standalone CLI, not a library. mdsmith
  cannot embed it; the user would have to install please
  separately and learn its BUILD-file dialect.
- **dagger / buildbarn** — container or distributed build
  focus. Wrong audience for a Markdown linter whose users
  are tech writers and devs.
- **mage / goyek** — both are programmable in Go, both run
  parallel deps, but neither tracks file content hashes.
  mage's `target` helper is mtime-only ([dependencies
  doc][mage-deps]); goyek does no file tracking.
- **go-task** — the only serious match. Single binary,
  built-in checksum mode, parallel deps. Detailed below.

## Why not go-task as the primary engine

go-task gets close but loses on five specific points:

1. **Checksum scope.** go-task hashes `sources:` only;
   `generates:` is excluded ([issue #238][issue-238]).
   Plan 103's staleness step 5 ("hand-edited artifact
   triggers rebuild") cannot be implemented inside
   go-task.
2. **No trust gate.** A fresh `git clone` of a hostile repo
   running `task` invokes every declared command. Plan 117
   exists because mdsmith cannot ship that default.
3. **No hermetic environment.** go-task inherits the
   parent shell environment. Plan 117 specifies an
   allowlisted `PATH` and explicit env pass-through.
4. **No atomic multi-output write.** A failing recipe in
   go-task leaves partial outputs. Plan 115 plus plan 117
   stage every output in a per-recipe temp directory and
   rename atomically; on failure no declared output is
   touched.
5. **No output-confinement post-conditions.** go-task does
   not detect when a recipe writes a file outside its
   declared `generates:`. Plan 117 snapshots the staging
   dir and the output-paths' parents and diffs after the
   recipe.

These are not nice-to-haves. Each addresses a specific
class of gotcha that surfaced in the prior gotchas spike
(see [Gotchas summary](#gotchas-summary)).

## Recommended architecture: internal engine + side door

```text
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ outer orchestrator      │  go-task / make / just / mage
│ (cross-tool DAG)        │  Optional. The user already runs
└──────────┬──────────────┘  this for their docs site.
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ mdsmith fix --build-only│  mdsmith owns the inner DAG:
│ (inner DAG)             │  staleness, recipe dispatch,
└──────────┬──────────────┘  trust gate, atomic write.
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ user-declared recipes   │  pandoc / mmdc / scripts / …
└─────────────────────────┘
```

mdsmith owns:

- Parsing `<?build?>` directives.
- Resolving `inputs:` and `outputs:` against the project.
- Computing the ActionID and consulting the cache.
- Dispatching recipes via `os/exec` with the trust gate,
  hermetic env, atomic multi-output write, and post-
  conditions.
- The lint-fix pass (rules + generated sections).

The outer orchestrator (optional) owns:

- Coordination across non-Markdown tools (npm, pandoc,
  pytest, etc.).
- Whichever node is named "mdsmith fix" — usually one node
  for `--no-build` (lint-fix) and one for `--build-only`
  (build).

### New mdsmith subcommand: `mdsmith targets --json`

One new subcommand opens the side door. Approximately
50 lines of Go on top of the existing parser:

```bash
$ mdsmith targets --json
[
  {
    "recipe": "pandoc",
    "inputs": ["chapters/intro.md", "chapters/01-prologue.md"],
    "outputs": ["book.html", "book.epub"],
    "source": "README.md",
    "line": 12
  },
  …
]
```

That output is enough for any orchestrator to generate a
Taskfile.yml, a Makefile, or a Justfile that invokes
`mdsmith fix --build-only --build-recipe NAME` per target.

### User-facing flow

```yaml
# Taskfile.yml
tasks:
  docs:
    deps: [docs:lint, docs:build]
  docs:lint:
    cmds: [mdsmith fix --no-build .]
    sources: ["**/*.md"]
  docs:build:
    cmds: [mdsmith fix --build-only .]
    sources: ["**/*.md", ".mdsmith.yml"]
    deps: [docs:lint]
```

go-task handles the *outer* DAG (mdsmith vs npm vs pandoc).
mdsmith handles the *inner* DAG (which `<?build?>` directive
is stale). Both use content hashing within their scope.

## Risks and unknowns

- **API stability of `mdsmith targets --json`.** Once the
  side door exists, downstream Taskfile / Makefile
  generators will rely on the JSON shape. Treat it as a
  versioned API.
- **Two trust surfaces.** If a user wires the side door,
  the outer orchestrator runs *its own* commands too. The
  trust gate (plan 117) only protects mdsmith's spawn,
  not the orchestrator's. Document this explicitly.
- **`mdsmith fix` vs `mdsmith fix --build-only` vs
  `--no-build` ergonomics.** Three modes is one too many
  if users get them wrong. Document a decision tree.
- **Generated sections + builds in one DAG.** mdsmith's
  lint-fix pass already runs both in the right order
  internally (plan 115). The external split is for cross-
  tool DAGs, not intra-mdsmith ones — the side door does
  not let an orchestrator interleave them.

## Gotchas summary

The previous "build system gotchas" research distilled
five lessons from Bazel, Buck, Gradle, Ninja, and others:

1. Buffered stdout hides hangs (Ninja [issue 545][ninja-545]).
2. Failure messages without argv, cwd, exit code, and
   log path are useless.
3. Stale-cache surprises drive `make clean` muscle memory
   unless mdsmith can explain freshness
   (Gradle [issue 14773][gradle-14773]).
4. Non-deterministic recipes silently defeat caching
   (Bazel determinism notes;
   [Buck2 issue #573][buck2-573]).
5. Parallel builds collide on undeclared shared state
   (CMake / zlib race-condition reports).

Plan 116 covers gotchas 1, 2, 3, and 4 (logs, failure
diagnostic, `--build-explain`, `--build-verify`). Plan 117
covers gotcha 5 (post-conditions catch undeclared writes
even under parallel execution). go-task as the engine
covers gotcha 5 only (its `deps:` parallelism does not
enforce output confinement).
