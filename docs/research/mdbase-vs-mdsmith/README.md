# mdsmith vs mdbase

This research note compares
[mdsmith](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith) — a Go
Markdown linter — with [mdbase](https://mdbase.dev) — a
specification for typed, queryable Markdown collections,
with a TypeScript reference implementation, a Node CLI,
and a Rust LSP. Both treat plain `.md` files on disk as
the source of truth and refuse to introduce a separate
artifact format. They differ on which layer of the
Markdown stack they own.

  comparison: distribution, config, type system,

- [use-cases.md](use-cases.md) — seven concrete

  vault, RFC tracker, task tracker, agent-
  maintained runbooks, knowledge graph, mixed
  wiki+plan tracker) that exercise where each
  tool fits
- [interop.md](interop.md) — running both tools on
  the same files: coexistence, the dual-schema
  problem, recommended layouts, future bridge
- [learn-from-mdbase.md](learn-from-mdbase.md) —
  systematic gap enumeration: every mdbase
  capability mdsmith doesn't have, with a per-gap
  mini-plan covering goal, sketch, surface,
  effort, and the **trigger** under which
  shipping it becomes worth the cost. mdsmith's
  feature set is open; this doc maps candidates
  rather than committing to any.
- [aggregation-use-cases.md](aggregation-use-cases.md)
  — six worked aggregation workloads (sprint
  dashboard, reviewer-load report, knowledge-graph
  backlinks, time-bucketed velocity, cross-type
  join, real-time editor decoration), the cases
  where a SQLite-class index pays vs. where it
  doesn't, and a serious look at stateless-fast
  (`fzf` / `ripgrep`-style) approaches as an
  alternative to a persistent cache. The deepest
  open design question for mdsmith.

## TL;DR

The two tools are complementary, not competitive.

**mdbase** is a specification for typed Markdown
collections. It defines how a folder of `.md` files
becomes a queryable, schema-validated database.
Implementations provide CRUD, schema typing, link
resolution, rename refactoring, query expressions
(Bases-compatible), and an SQLite-backed cache. The
spec is at version 0.2.1 (early release) with
reference implementations in TypeScript, a Node CLI,
and a Rust LSP.

**mdsmith** is a single Go binary that lints, fixes,
and regenerates Markdown. It owns prose readability,
structural rules, generated sections (catalog, TOC,
include, build), and a CUE-based front-matter schema.
54 rules ship in the binary. Stable today, no
network, no daemon, no cache.

Both projects:

- Treat the filesystem as authoritative
- Refuse a proprietary file format
- Ship offline, single-binary or single-package
- Target the same Obsidian-and-Git audience
- Read YAML front matter as the structured layer

The overlap region is **front-matter typing and
querying**. mdsmith's [file kinds][file-kinds] and
[required-structure][mds020] rule cover the same
ground as mdbase types, but with different syntax
(CUE vs an mdbase-specific schema DSL) and different
ownership (lint config vs `_types/` Markdown files).
The non-overlap region is **everything else**: prose
rules, fixers, and regenerable sections live only in
mdsmith; rename refactoring, the query language, and
the SQLite cache live only in mdbase.

## Same problem, different layer

A picture helps. Both tools sit on the same files but
own different layers of behavior.

   mdsmith owns:     overlap region:    mdbase owns:
   - prose rules     - FM typing        - rename refactor
   - structure       - FM querying      - backlink graph
   - readability     - kind/type        - watch events
   - catalog, TOC      assignment       - SQLite index
   - include, build  - schema           - link traversal
   - merge driver      validation       - CRUD operations
   - LSP diagnostics                    - Bases queries
   - 54 lint rules                      - migrations
```

The "overlap region" is where teams running both will
feel friction: today there is no way to share the
schema. mdsmith reads CUE; mdbase reads its own DSL.
[interop.md](interop.md) covers the workarounds.

## Reading order

For a tool comparison, start with
[features.md](features.md) for the mechanical
breakdown, then [workflows.md](workflows.md) for
daily-work feel, then [use-cases.md](use-cases.md)
for seven concrete scenarios that show where each
tool fits, and finally [interop.md](interop.md)
for combining both.

For a design exercise, read
[learn-from-mdbase.md](learn-from-mdbase.md):
every gap mdsmith has against mdbase, sketched as
a mini-plan with a concrete trigger for when
shipping it would pay. Then dive into
[aggregation-use-cases.md](aggregation-use-cases.md)
for the toughest open question — when, if ever,
mdsmith should grow an index — including a
serious look at stateless-fast (`fzf` /
`ripgrep`-style) approaches as an alternative to
a SQLite cache.
