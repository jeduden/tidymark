# Interop and combined use

This document covers what happens when both tools
read the same files. The short answer: they coexist
cleanly on disk because their write surfaces do not
collide, but the dual-schema problem makes typed
front matter more work than it should be.

## 1. Coexistence on disk

Both tools read YAML front matter and Markdown body
content. Neither tool requires a proprietary
serialization. Files written by one are valid for
the other.

Write surfaces:

| Tool    | What it writes                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mdsmith | Body fixes (`mdsmith fix`); generated section bodies (catalog, TOC, include, build); `.gitattributes` + git hooks via merge-driver / pre-merge-commit installers            |
| mdbase  | Front-matter via CRUD ops (`create`, `update`); incoming-link rewrites on `rename`; SQLite cache at `.mdbase/index.sqlite`; migration manifests under `_types/_migrations/` |

These do not overlap. Specifically:

- mdsmith does not edit front matter (rules read it;
  fixes target body content)
- mdbase does not edit body content (CRUD targets
  fields, not paragraphs; rename rewrites links but
  not surrounding prose)

So a file edited by mdbase remains lint-clean if it
was clean before, and a file fixed by mdsmith
remains valid against its mdbase type if it was
valid before. The exception is the front-matter
*shape*, which both tools have opinions about — that
is the dual-schema problem.

## 2. The dual-schema problem

Both tools want to validate front matter, and
neither can read the other's schema language.

| Concern                            | mdsmith                                                                    | mdbase                               |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Schema file format                 | Markdown `proto.md` (CUE in front matter, heading template in body)        | Markdown in `_types/<name>.md` (DSL) |
| Schema reference                   | `kinds: { <name>: { rules: { required-structure: { schema: <path> } } } }` | folder convention `_types/`          |
| Schema location                    | anywhere referenced by a kind, by convention next to the files             | fixed `_types/` folder               |
| Schema discoverable from file tree | yes — `proto.md` is a normal Markdown file                                 | yes — `_types/*.md` are normal files |
| Reads the other's schema           | no                                                                         | no                                   |

The pain points:

1. **Define-once is impossible.** A team that wants
   typed FM under both tools maintains two
   definitions of every type. Field renames must be
   applied twice. Constraint changes must be
   applied twice.
2. **Drift is silent.** If only one schema is
   updated, the other tool keeps validating against
   the old shape. A file might pass mdsmith and fail
   mdbase, or vice versa.
3. **Tooling cannot cross-reference.** A schema
   editor for mdsmith does not see mdbase types; a
   schema editor for mdbase does not see CUE
   constraints.

There is no automated bridge today. Strategies that
work in practice are below.

## 3. Strategies for combined use

### Strategy A: Use mdbase as the source of truth

Pick mdbase types as the authoritative schema. Use
mdsmith for **everything else** (prose, structure,
generated content, link integrity) and skip MDS020
entirely.

```yaml
# .mdsmith.yml
rules:
  required-structure: false  # mdbase owns FM validation
```

Pros:

- One schema layer (`_types/`) to maintain
- mdsmith stays focused on what it does best
- The schema is self-documenting (each type file
  has a body explaining the type)

Cons:

- mdsmith cannot block PRs on FM-shape errors;
  rely on `mdbase validate` in CI
- The CUE constraint surface (cross-field, regex,
  bounds) is not available

This is the recommended pattern when you want the
mdbase typed-vault experience plus mdsmith's
linting.

### Strategy B: Use mdsmith CUE as the source of truth

The opposite: keep CUE as the authoritative schema.
Use mdbase as a query and rename tool only, with
its validation set to `off`:

```yaml
# mdbase.yaml
spec_version: "0.2.1"
default_validation: off
```

Pros:

- One schema layer (CUE) to maintain
- CUE's full constraint power
- Seamless on existing mdsmith repos

Cons:

- mdbase types still exist as data-layer hints
  (otherwise queries can't filter by type)
- Can't use mdbase create/update because they
  validate-on-write — workaround: use raw FM editing
  and rely on mdsmith for shape

This pattern fits teams already invested in mdsmith
who want only mdbase's rename-and-query features.

### Strategy C: Maintain both, by hand

Keep CUE schemas and mdbase types in sync manually.
Convention: a single PR updates both. A pre-commit
check could compare the two but no such tool exists
today.

Pros:

- Both tools enforce on PRs; defense in depth
- Schema authoring stays close to either tool's
  natural surface

Cons:

- Drift is the default state
- Diff review must check that schemas match

Use only if both validation surfaces matter and the
drift cost is acceptable.

### Strategy D: Generate one from the other

Write a script that:

- Reads `_types/*.md` (mdbase types)
- Emits matching mdsmith `proto.md` schema files
  next to the matching kind, with the type DSL
  translated into CUE in the front matter and the
  documentation body preserved or replaced with a
  heading template

Or the reverse direction. Run the script in CI; fail
if the generated output drifts from committed
content.

Pros:

- Single source of truth, low drift risk
- Can be incremental (only types that need both)

Cons:

- The script is real engineering effort
- Some constraints don't translate (CUE regex →
  mdbase `pattern:` works; CUE cross-field
  constraints → mdbase has no equivalent)

This is the "right answer" but requires building a
bridge nobody has built yet. See section 7 for a
sketch.

## 4. Recommended folder layout

Below is one layout that runs both tools cleanly.

```text
my-vault/
├── mdbase.yaml              # mdbase config
├── .mdsmith.yml             # mdsmith config (kinds + rules)
├── _types/                  # mdbase type defs (Strategy A)
│   ├── note.md
│   ├── task.md
│   └── person.md
├── notes/                   # actual content
│   ├── proto.md             # mdsmith schema (Strategy B/C; CUE in FM)
│   ├── 2026-05-05-meeting.md
│   └── …
├── tasks/
│   ├── proto.md             # mdsmith schema for tasks
│   └── …
├── _types/_migrations/      # mdbase migrations (L6)
└── .mdbase/                 # gitignored cache
    └── index.sqlite
```

`.gitignore` entries:

```text
.mdbase/
```

`.mdsmith.yml` `ignore:` entries:

```yaml
ignore:
  - "_types/**"      # mdbase owns these; skip MDS020 etc.
  - ".mdbase/**"
```

`mdbase.yaml` `exclude:` entries:

```yaml
exclude:
  - .git
  - node_modules
  - .mdbase
  - .mdsmith.yml   # not a content file
```

This keeps each tool out of the other's territory.
mdsmith does not lint type files (mdbase owns them).
mdbase does not consider hidden config files as part
of the collection.

## 5. Rules to disable when using both

mdsmith rules to consider disabling under
**Strategy A (mdbase owns FM)**:

| Rule             | Reason to disable                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| MDS020           | mdbase validates FM shape                        |
| MDS027           | optional: mdbase L4 also checks links — pick one |
| MDS019 (catalog) | mdbase queries can produce equivalent listings   |

Keep these:

- All prose / structure / readability rules — mdbase
  has nothing equivalent
- `<?include?>` — useful regardless
- `<?toc?>` — useful regardless
- Merge driver — useful regardless

Conversely under **Strategy B (mdsmith owns FM)**,
disable mdbase validation:

```yaml
# mdbase.yaml
default_validation: off
```

…and rely on `mdsmith check` for FM shape. mdbase
becomes a query/rename tool only.

## 6. Sample CI pipeline

Combined CI for a vault running both tools:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint.yml
name: lint
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.25'   # match mdsmith's go.mod
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      # Pin a specific mdsmith release to keep CI reproducible.
      - run: go install github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/cmd/mdsmith@vX.Y.Z
      - run: npm install -g mdbase-cli
      - run: mdsmith check .
      - run: mdbase validate
```

Both run on every PR. They produce independent
reports; either failing fails the job. Order does
not matter — the tools do not write during validation.
The Go version should track mdsmith's `go.mod`
directive; pinning the install version (rather than
`@latest`) keeps CI reproducible across mdsmith
releases.

If you also want fix-mode in CI (as a regression
guard against drift in generated sections):

```yaml
      - run: mdsmith fix .
      - run: |
          if ! git diff --quiet; then
            echo "mdsmith fix produced changes; commit them"
            git --no-pager diff
            exit 1
          fi
```

This catches a contributor who edited a generated
section by hand.

## 7. Future: a schema bridge

There is room for a small tool that translates
between the two schema surfaces. Sketch:

```text
                    mdbase _types/*.md
                        │
                        ▼
              ┌─────────────────────┐
              │  schema-bridge tool │
              │   (read both,       │
              │   diff, generate)   │
              └─────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼
              mdsmith proto.md schemas
              (CUE in front matter,
               heading template in body)
```

A first cut would handle the common subset:

- `string` with `min_length` / `max_length` / `pattern`
  → CUE `=~ "regex" & strings.MinRunes(N)`
- `integer` with `min`/`max` → CUE `int & >=N & <=M`
- `enum` with `values` → CUE disjunction
- `list` with `items` → CUE list type
- `object` with `fields` → CUE struct
- `required` → CUE non-optional
- `default` → CUE default value `*"x" | string`

Things that don't translate cleanly:

- mdbase `link` with `target` — needs cross-file
  resolution that CUE alone cannot express
- mdbase `computed:` — CUE has expressions but
  evaluation semantics differ
- mdbase `generated:` (ULID, timestamps on write) —
  CUE is purely structural; no write-time hooks
- CUE cross-field constraints (`if x then y >= 0`) —
  mdbase has no equivalent

The bridge tool would round-trip the common cases
and emit warnings where one side has constraints
the other cannot represent. This is a clear
opportunity for a small contribution to either
ecosystem.

## 8. When to skip one tool

A team running both does not always benefit. Cases
where one tool alone is enough:

| Project shape                                          | Use only            |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Open-source repo with `docs/` and a README             | mdsmith             |
| Static site Markdown (Hugo / Jekyll / Astro)           | mdsmith + SSG       |
| Personal Obsidian vault, no CI, no schemas             | mdbase (or neither) |
| Knowledge graph with backlinks and rename-heavy work   | mdbase              |
| Plan / RFC tracker with status fields and prose review | mdsmith             |
| Mixed vault + docs site for a product                  | both                |

The core trigger to add the second tool:

- Add **mdsmith** when you start caring about prose
  consistency, structural rules, generated TOCs,
  or Markdown across many contributors.
- Add **mdbase** when you start caring about typed
  records, rename safety, backlinks, or queries
  beyond `grep`.

## 9. Open questions

A few things this comparison doesn't answer:

1. How does mdbase's SQLite cache interact with
   editor saves on Windows where `.mdbase/index.sqlite`
   is a binary file with active locks?
2. Does mdbase-lsp expose code actions for adding a
   missing required field, the way mdsmith does for
   formatting fixes?
3. Can mdsmith ship a `link-rename` subcommand that
   approximates mdbase L5 rename for projects that
   don't want a second tool?
4. Is there appetite in either project to specify a
   shared FM-schema interchange format?

These are tractable questions, but answering them
needs experimentation against real vaults. The
research note ends here; the experiments are
follow-up work.
