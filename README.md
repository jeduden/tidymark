## ✨ Why mdsmith

**🔧 Auto-fix Markdown formatting.**
`mdsmith fix` rewrites whitespace, headings, code fences,
bare URLs, list indentation, and table alignment in place,
re-running until edits settle. `mdsmith check` is the
read-only CI sibling.

**✏️ Live diagnostics wherever you write.**
`mdsmith lsp` powers the [VS Code extension][vsc-mp]
(quick-fixes plus opt-in fix-on-save),
[Open VSX][vsc-ovsx] for Cursor, VSCodium, Theia, and
Gitpod, and any LSP client (Neovim, Helix, JetBrains).
The [Claude Code plugin](docs/guides/install.md) loads the
same server so agents editing Markdown inside Claude Code
see mdsmith diagnostics and link navigation inline.

**🔗 Cross-file integrity.**
Built-in rules flag broken links and missing anchors
([`MDS027`](internal/rules/MDS027-cross-file-reference-integrity/README.md)),
enforce per-file section schemas
([`MDS020`](internal/rules/MDS020-required-structure/README.md)),
and keep Markdown in the right folders
([`MDS033`](internal/rules/MDS033-directory-structure/README.md)).
Schemas can be inline on a
[file kind](docs/guides/file-kinds.md) or shared via proto
files.

**🤖 Guardrails for AI-generated docs.**
Cap [file](internal/rules/MDS022-max-file-length/README.md),
[section](internal/rules/MDS036-max-section-length/README.md),
and
[token-budget](internal/rules/MDS028-token-budget/README.md)
size; enforce
[reading grade and sentence count](internal/rules/MDS023-paragraph-readability/README.md);
flag
[verbatim copy-paste](internal/rules/MDS037-duplicated-content/README.md)
across files.

**📋 Self-maintaining sections.**
On `mdsmith fix`, `<?toc?>` rebuilds a heading
table-of-contents, `<?catalog?>` assembles a table from
matching files' front matter, and `<?include?>` splices in
another file. `merge-driver install` registers a Git
driver that auto-resolves merge conflicts inside those
blocks.

**📊 Gate releases on doc status.**
`mdsmith list query 'status: "✅"' plan/` selects files by
a [CUE expression](docs/reference/cli/query.md) on front
matter;
`mdsmith metrics rank --by token-estimate --top 10 docs/`
ranks files by any shared metric — both ready to pipe into
a release script.

**📖 Rule docs your agent can read.**
`mdsmith help rule [name]` prints settings, examples, and
diagnostics straight from the binary — no network. Drop
the output into `.cursor/rules`, `AGENTS.md`, or
`CLAUDE.md` and your agent knows the rules without an
extra fetch.

## 📦 Installation

CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/cmd/mdsmith@latest
npm install -g @mdsmith/cli    # or: npx @mdsmith/cli
pip install mdsmith            # or: uvx mdsmith / pipx install mdsmith
```

Editor extension (LSP-backed; runs `mdsmith lsp`):

```bash
code --install-extension jeduden.mdsmith     # VS Code, Codespaces (Marketplace)
codium --install-extension jeduden.mdsmith   # Cursor, VSCodium, Theia, Gitpod (Open VSX)
```

Any LSP-aware editor (Neovim, Helix, JetBrains via the LSP
plugin) works by pointing at `mdsmith lsp`.

Claude Code plugin (inline diagnostics plus definition,
references, symbol search, and call-hierarchy queries
across your docs):

```text
/plugin marketplace add jeduden/mdsmith
/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith
/reload-plugins
```

direct downloads and mise (asdf pending).
[VS Code integration](docs/guides/editors/vscode.md) covers

Files can be paths, directories (walked recursively for `*.md`
and `*.markdown`), or glob patterns. Directories respect
`.gitignore` by default;
use `--no-gitignore` to override. Explicitly named files are
never filtered by `.gitignore`.

### Examples

```bash
mdsmith check docs/            # lint a directory
mdsmith fix README.md          # auto-fix in place
mdsmith check -f json docs/    # JSON output
mdsmith metrics rank --by bytes --top 10 .
```

See the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md) for shared
flags, exit codes, output format, and configuration merge
semantics. Individual subcommand pages above cover their
own flags and examples.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Run `mdsmith init` to generate a `.mdsmith.yml` with every rule and its
defaults. Without a config, rules run with built-in defaults.

```yaml
rules:
  line-length:
    max: 120
  fenced-code-language: false

ignore:
  - "vendor/**"

overrides:
  - glob: ["CHANGELOG.md"]
    rules:
      no-duplicate-headings: false
```

Rules are `true` (defaults), `false` (off), or an object with settings.
`overrides` apply per file pattern; later entries take precedence.
Config is discovered by walking up to the repo root; `--config` overrides.

Commit `.mdsmith.yml` so contributors share the same rule settings and
mdsmith upgrades become an explicit, reviewable change. Run
`mdsmith version` to see the build you have installed.
