"""Open a GitHub issue when a long-lived secret is due for rotation.

The source of truth is the `rotations:` table in the front matter of
`docs/development/secret-rotations.md`. For each entry the script
computes (today - last-rotated). If that exceeds period-days minus
the reminder window (30 days), the script opens a single open issue
per secret with a stable title so reruns are idempotent.

The script does not close issues. After rotation the human edits the
`last-rotated` date in the doc, merges the change, and closes the
issue. The next scheduled run sees the new date and waits.

Exit codes:
- 0: ran cleanly (regardless of whether any issue was opened)
- 1: doc missing / malformed / `gh` failure / unknown secret kind
