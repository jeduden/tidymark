# Archetypes

An **archetype** is a shared pattern used by one or more
rules. Each archetype page covers the common mechanics.
Each rule README covers its own settings and behavior.

| Archetype         | Description                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [generated-section](generated-section/) | Marker-based sections with YAML config, template output, and auto-fix. |
