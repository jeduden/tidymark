# Archetypes

An **archetype** is a shared behavioral pattern implemented by
one or more rules. Archetype documentation describes the common
mechanics; individual rule READMEs document rule-specific
parameters and behavior.

| Archetype | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [generated-section](generated-section/) | Marker-delimited sections with YAML-configured content generation, template rendering, and auto-fix. |
