## Development Workflow

- Any change follows Red / Green TDD: write a failing
  test (red), make it pass (green), commit
- Keep commits small and focused on one change
- Run `mdsmith check .` before committing to ensure all
  markdown files pass linting
- Never modify `.mdsmith.yml` (linter configuration)
  without explicit user consent — this includes rule
  settings, overrides, ignore patterns, and file-length
  limits

## PR Workflow

Use `gh` for all GitHub PR operations:

```bash
# View PR comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# List review comments on a PR
gh api repos/"$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner \
  -q '.nameWithOwner')"/pulls/<number>/comments \
  --paginate

# Resolve a review thread after addressing it
gh api graphql -f query='mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "ID"}) {
    thread { id isResolved }
  }
}'

# Push updates after addressing comments
git push origin <branch>
```

These commands are auto-approved in
[`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json).

## Plan Maintenance

When implementing work tracked by a plan file in
`plan/`:

- Update the plan file **as part of the
  implementation**, not as a separate follow-up
- Check off each task (`- [x]`) as it is completed
- Check off each acceptance criterion when verified
- When all acceptance criteria are met, change the
  front-matter `status` from `🔲` or `🔳` to `✅`
- When work begins on a not-started plan, change
  `status` from `🔲` to `🔳`
- If the implementation deviates from the plan
  (e.g. a parameter name changes), update the plan
  text to match what was actually built
- Run `mdsmith fix PLAN.md` after changing a plan's
  front matter so the catalog table stays current

## Writing Guidelines

When writing descriptions, state the concrete constraint:
what specific data must satisfy what condition. Name the
inputs (front matter fields, glob pattern, heading level)
not just the mechanism. Avoid vague verbs (match, sync,
reflect) without saying what is checked against what.
