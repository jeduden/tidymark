## Development Workflow

- Any change follows Red / Green TDD: write a failing
  test (red), make it pass (green), commit
- Keep commits small and focused on one change
- Run `mdsmith check .` before committing to ensure all
  markdown files pass linting

## PR Workflow

Use `gh` for all GitHub PR operations:

```bash
# View PR comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# List review comments on a PR
gh api "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner \
  -q '.nameWithOwner')/pulls/<number>/comments" \
  --paginate

# Push updates after addressing comments
git push origin <branch>
```

These commands are auto-approved in
`.claude/settings.json`.

## Plans

Task plans live in [`plan/`](plan/). See
[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the current status of all
plans. Use [`plan/proto.md`](plan/proto.md) as a
template when creating new plans.

## Writing Guidelines

When writing descriptions, state the concrete constraint:
what specific data must satisfy what condition. Name the
inputs (front matter fields, glob pattern, heading level)
not just the mechanism. Avoid vague verbs (match, sync,
reflect) without saying what is checked against what.
