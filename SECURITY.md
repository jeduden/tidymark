# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by opening a [GitHub Security
Advisory](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/security/advisories/new).
Do not file a public issue.

The maintainer aims to acknowledge reports within
five business days.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest minor release receives security
updates. Pin to a specific patch version in CI and
update via dependabot.

## Release Pipeline and Supply-Chain Posture

The release pipeline lives in
[`docs/development/release.md`](docs/development/release.md).
It is the single source of truth. It covers the
workflow structure, the OIDC trusted publishers,
the `release` environment that gates publishing
jobs, and the supply-chain hardening features baked
into the pipeline. Each publishing channel has its
own file under
[`docs/development/release-channels/`](docs/development/release-channels/).
The release-pipeline doc enumerates them via a
`<?catalog?>` directive.

## Verifying a Released Artifact

Cosign, `gh attestation verify`, and `sha256sum -c`
commands live in the
[installation guide](docs/guides/install.md#github-release-direct-download).
Every step resolves through the workflow's GitHub
OIDC identity. A forged binary or rewritten
checksums file fails verification unless the
attacker also controls `release.yml` on this
repository.

## Security Audit Log

Point-in-time security reviews live in
[`docs/security/`](docs/security/) and follow the
filename pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Each note
records the scope, the review method, the findings,
and the fix or follow-up.
