# Markdown Linters Comparison

This document compares mdsmith with popular Markdown
linting and formatting tools. It also covers the emerging
use of LLMs as linters.

## Tool Overview

### mdsmith

Go binary. 30 rules (MDS001-MDS030) covering structural
linting, readability metrics, and generated-content
management. Single binary with zero runtime dependencies.

Key differentiators:

- Token-budget rule (MDS028) targeting LLM context windows
- Paragraph readability (ARI grade) and structure limits
- Regenerable sections: catalog, include, required-structure
- Git merge driver for auto-resolving generated sections
- Metrics subsystem (bytes, lines, words, headings, tokens)
- Offline rule docs compiled into the binary

### markdownlint (markdownlint-cli2)

Node.js. ~60 built-in rules (MD001-MD058), 31 auto-fixable.
The most widely adopted Markdown linter. GitHub uses it
internally via markdownlint-github.

- Config: JSONC, YAML, or JS
- Official VS Code extension and GitHub Action
- Custom rules via npm packages
- Mature ecosystem with Prettier compatibility presets
- ~5.9k GitHub stars (library)

### remark-lint

Node.js. ~70 rules distributed as individual npm packages.
Part of the unified/remark AST pipeline ecosystem.

- Architecture: parse to mdast AST, lint, serialize
- Three maintained presets (consistent, recommended, style)
- "Fix" by round-tripping through AST (reformat entire file)
- Powers MDX, Gatsby, and Next.js documentation
- Deep composability with unified plugins
- ~7k stars (remark parent project)

### Prettier

Node.js. Opinionated formatter, not a linter. ~51.6k stars.

- Reformats Markdown with zero config
- Formats embedded code blocks (JS, TS, CSS, JSON, etc.)
- Key option: `proseWrap` (preserve, always, never)
- No diagnostics, no structural checks, no rule toggles
- Best paired with a linter for structural validation

### Vale

Go binary. Prose and style linter, not a structural linter.
Checks writing quality against style guides (Microsoft,
Google, AP, custom). ~5.2k stars.

- 11 extension points (existence, substitution, metric, etc.)
- Styles are YAML rule files; no code required
- Config: `.vale.ini` (INI format)
- Markup-aware: Markdown, HTML, RST, AsciiDoc, DITA, XML
- Used by Grafana, GitLab, DigitalOcean for docs
- Official GitHub Action and VS Code extension

### textlint

Node.js. Zero built-in rules, fully pluggable architecture
modeled after ESLint. ~3k stars.

- 100+ community rules available via npm
- Parser plugins for Markdown, HTML, RST, AsciiDoc, Typst
- Autofix via `--fix` for rules implementing the fixer API
- MCP server support (v15.2+) for AI assistant integration
- Strong Japanese language support

### LLM as Linter

Using language models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) directly to
check prose quality, conciseness, and style. This is
emerging through dedicated CLI tools and AI review bots.

How it works:

- Send Markdown to an LLM with a style prompt
- LLM returns diagnostics: verbose paragraphs, unclear
  phrasing, jargon, redundancy
- Tools wrap this in CLI or CI workflows

Dedicated tools:

- **VectorLint**: CLI AI prose linter. Rules defined in
  natural language in a `VECTORLINT.md` file. Uses
  error-density scoring and 1-4 rubrics. Supports
  OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers.
- **GPTLint**: two-pass LLM linter. A cheap model finds
  candidates, a strong model filters false positives.
  Uses GritQL to pre-filter files. Cost: ~$0.83 for
  351 API calls on a small codebase.

AI review services:

- GitHub Copilot code review (reviews Markdown in PRs)
- CodeRabbit (combines 40+ linters with LLM review)
- Claude Code Action (Anthropic's PR review action)

Hybrid systems:

- Grammarly: rule-based grammar + ML models + LLMs.
  Their CoEdIT model (770M-11B params) beats GPT-3
  at text editing while being 60x smaller.

Strengths:

- Excels at subjective quality: conciseness, clarity
- Catches semantic issues no rule-based tool can detect
- A single natural-language instruction replaces many
  regex patterns (e.g. "flag hedging language")
- Understands context and intent, not just patterns

Weaknesses:

- Non-deterministic: same input may yield different
  output, even at temperature=0
- Costly: API calls per file per run add up
- Slow: seconds per file vs milliseconds for rules
- Requires network (local LLMs work but lower quality)
- Hard to use as a blocking CI gate reliably

| Duplicate headings  | MDS005    | MD024        | no-duplicate-headings |
| Blank line spacing  | MDS013-15 | MD022,25,31  | plugins               |
| List indentation    | MDS016    | MD007        | list-item-indent      |
| Code fence style    | MDS010    | MD048        | fenced-code-flag      |
| Code block language | MDS011    | MD040        | fenced-code-flag      |
| Bare URLs           | MDS012    | MD034        | no-literal-urls       |
| Line length         | MDS001    | MD013        | max-line-length       |
| Trailing spaces     | MDS006    | MD009        | no-trailing-spaces    |

All three cover core structural rules. markdownlint has
the broadest rule set (~60 rules). mdsmith and remark-lint
are comparable in structural coverage.

### Rules mdsmith Lacks

markdownlint has ~30 rules without mdsmith equivalents.
Notable gaps:

| Rule area         | markdownlint         | remark-lint           |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Inline HTML       | MD033 no-inline-html | no-html               |
| Image alt text    | MD045 no-alt-text    | no-empty-image-alt    |
| OL numbering      | MD029 ol-prefix      | ordered-list-marker   |
| UL marker style   | MD004 ul-style       | unordered-list-marker |
| Emphasis style    | MD049, MD050         | emphasis-marker       |
| HR style          | MD035 hr-style       | rule-style            |
| Space in emphasis | MD037                | no                    |
| Space in code     | MD038                | no                    |
| Space in links    | MD039                | no                    |
| Proper names      | MD044                | no                    |
| Required headings | MD043                | no                    |
| Single H1         | MD047                | no                    |
| Link fragments    | MD051                | no                    |
| Reference links   | MD052, MD053         | no                    |

mdsmith covers readability, tokens, and generated content
rather than formatting details. Teams that need full
coverage can pair mdsmith with markdownlint.

### Prose and Readability

| Capability        | mdsmith          | Vale             | LLM |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-----|
| Readability grade | MDS023 (ARI)     | metric ext       | yes |
| Sentence limits   | MDS024           | occurrence ext   | yes |
| Word choice       | no               | substitution ext | yes |
| Passive voice     | no               | existence ext    | yes |
| Jargon detection  | no               | existence ext    | yes |
| Conciseness       | MDS029 (planned) | no               | yes |
| Tone enforcement  | no               | custom styles    | yes |
| Token budget      | MDS028           | no               | no  |
| Deterministic     | yes              | yes              | no  |

mdsmith focuses on measurable readability metrics (ARI
grade, sentence count, token budget). Vale excels at style
guide enforcement. LLMs handle subjective quality best but
lack determinism.

### Formatting and Fixing

| Capability         | mdsmith          | Prettier       | markdownlint |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Autofix CLI        | `fix`              | `--write`        | `--fix`        |
| Table alignment    | MDS025           | yes            | no           |
| Prose wrapping     | no               | `proseWrap`      | no           |
| Embedded code fmt  | no               | JS/TS/CSS/JSON | no           |
| Multi-pass fix     | yes              | single pass    | single pass  |
| Generated sections | catalog, include | no             | no           |

Prettier is the strongest pure formatter. mdsmith has
unique autofix for generated content (catalog, include).
markdownlint fixes structural violations.

### Cross-File and Project Features

| Capability           | mdsmith | markdownlint | remark-lint           |
|----------------------|---------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Link integrity       | MDS027  | no           | remark-validate-links |
| Include sections     | MDS021  | no           | no                    |
| Catalog generation   | MDS019  | no           | no                    |
| Required structure   | MDS020  | no           | no                    |
| Git merge driver     | yes     | no           | no                    |
| Metrics ranking      | yes     | no           | no                    |
| Gitignore aware      | yes     | yes          | no                    |
| Front matter support | yes     | via plugin   | via plugin            |

mdsmith has the strongest cross-file and project-level
features. The merge driver and regenerable sections are
unique to mdsmith.

Go-based tools (mdsmith, Vale) have zero runtime
dependencies. Node.js tools require a runtime but benefit
from the npm ecosystem. LLM-based linting requires network
access and is non-deterministic.

## When to Use What

**mdsmith** fits best when you need readability limits,
token budgets, or generated content sections. Its single
binary makes CI setup simple.

**markdownlint** is the safe default for teams already in the
Node.js ecosystem. Widest community adoption, most editor
integrations, battle-tested rule set.

**remark-lint** suits projects deep in the unified/remark
ecosystem (MDX, Gatsby, Next.js). Its AST pipeline enables
custom transformations beyond linting.

**Prettier** is a formatter, not a linter. Use it alongside a
linter. Pair with markdownlint (using the Prettier compat
preset) or remark-lint for structural checks.

**Vale** is the right choice for enforcing prose style guides
(Microsoft, Google, AP). It complements structural linters
rather than replacing them.

**textlint** works well for polyglot text linting (especially
Japanese) and teams wanting ESLint-style modularity.

**LLM as linter** is best for subjective quality checks:
conciseness, clarity, tone. Use it in PR review workflows
where latency and cost are acceptable. Pair with a
deterministic linter for structural rules.

## Combining Tools

Most teams benefit from layering tools. Common pairings:

- **Structure + format**: markdownlint + Prettier
- **Structure + prose**: mdsmith + Vale
- **Structure + AI review**: mdsmith + LLM review in CI
- **Full stack**: mdsmith (structure + readability) + Vale
  (style) + Prettier (formatting)

mdsmith's conciseness-scoring rule (MDS029, planned) brings
LLM-grade quality checks into an offline, rule-based tool.
It uses classifier-backed scoring to bridge the gap between
static rules and LLM review.

## Front Matter and Document Templates

Front matter (YAML between `---` delimiters) is a key
integration point. Tools handle it differently.

**mdsmith** uses front matter in three rules:

- **catalog (MDS019)**: reads front matter fields from
  matched files to build summary tables. Fields become
  template variables (`{{.title}}`, `{{.status}}`).
- **required-structure (MDS020)**: validates document
  headings and front matter against a template. Supports
  CUE schemas for field types and constraints.
- **include (MDS021)**: strips front matter from included
  files by default (`strip-frontmatter: true`).

mdsmith also provides **proto files** as templates for
rule and metric docs. The proto defines required front
matter fields (id, name, status, description) with CUE
validation patterns, required heading structure, and
content guidelines. Every rule README is validated
against its proto via the required-structure rule.

Front matter validation as a standalone rule (checking
required fields and types) is planned but not yet built.

**markdownlint** has no built-in front matter awareness.
It strips front matter to avoid false positives but does
not inspect its content. Custom rules can access it.

**remark-lint** supports front matter via the
`remark-frontmatter` plugin. Rules can then inspect the
parsed YAML. No built-in validation rules exist.

**Prettier** preserves front matter blocks but does not
format or validate their content.

**Vale** is front-matter-aware: it skips YAML blocks to
avoid false positives on metadata fields.

## Progressive Disclosure

mdsmith's catalog rule (MDS019) implements progressive
disclosure for documentation sets. A summary table gives
readers the overview; each row links to the full document
for details. Running `mdsmith fix` keeps the table in
sync with source front matter.

This pattern is useful for large repos where readers need
to find the right document without reading everything.
No other linter in this comparison generates or maintains
navigational tables from document metadata.

## Slidev and Presentation Markdown

Slidev uses Markdown files as slide decks. Slides are
split by `---` lines, with YAML front matter for config.
No tool in this comparison has Slidev support:

- Linters treat `---` separators as horizontal rules,
  which may trigger false positives
- Front matter blocks between slides may confuse parsers
  that expect a single front matter block at file start
- Slidev-specific directives (layout, clicks, transitions)
  appear as YAML or HTML comments that linters ignore

Teams using Slidev alongside standard Markdown docs
should use separate config overrides (e.g. ignore or
relaxed rules) for presentation files.
