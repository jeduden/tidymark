Enqueue a PR into the label-driven merge queue
(`jeduden/merge-queue-action`).

## Steps

### 1. Identify the PR

If a PR number was passed as an argument, use it.
Otherwise detect it from the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

Note the number as `$PR`.

### 2. Verify readiness

Confirm CI is green, no review threads are
unresolved, and the latest commit has a Copilot
review before enqueuing.

Check CI:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR" --json name,state
```

All checks must show `SUCCESS`. If any are
`FAILURE` or `PENDING`, stop and report the
blockers instead of enqueuing.

Check that Copilot reviewed the latest commit:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR/reviews" \
  -q '[.[] | select(.user.login ==
  "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]")]
  | last | .commit_id'
```

Compare the returned commit SHA with the PR head:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json commits \
  -q '.commits[-1].oid'
```

If the two SHAs do not match, Copilot has not
reviewed the latest push. Request a review and
wait before enqueuing:

```bash
gh api --method POST \
  "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR/requested_reviewers" \
  -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
```

### 3. Add the `queue` label

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --add-label queue
```

### 4. Monitor label progression

The action moves the PR through three labels:

| Label          | Meaning                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `queue`        | PR is waiting to be picked up     |
| `queue:active` | PR is in the current batch        |
| `queue:failed` | CI failed or merge conflict found |

Check the current label:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json labels \
  -q '.labels[].name'
```

Check the merge queue workflow run:

```bash
gh run list --workflow merge-queue.yml \
  --limit 1
```

### 5. Handle failure

If the label changes to `queue:failed`, read the
action's comment on the PR for the failure cause:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --comments
```

Fix the issue, push, then swap labels to
re-enter the queue:

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --remove-label queue:failed
```

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --add-label queue
```

### 6. Confirm merge

The PR is merged when `gh pr view "$PR"` shows
state `MERGED`. Report success and the merge
commit SHA:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json state,mergeCommit \
  -q '.state + " " + .mergeCommit.oid'
```
