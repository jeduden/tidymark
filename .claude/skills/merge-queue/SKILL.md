Enqueue a PR into the label-driven merge queue
(`jeduden/merge-queue-action`).

## Before you run commands

Run each fenced Bash block as its own Bash call.
Do not combine commands into one shell invocation,
and do not prefix commands with inline environment
or shell variable assignments. Allowed-tools
matching checks the command prefix, so changing
that prefix can cause an otherwise-allowed `gh`
command to be blocked.

## Steps

### 1. Identify the PR

If a PR number was passed as an argument, use it.
Otherwise detect it from the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

Note the number as `$PR`. Then get the repo
owner and name for API calls:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json headRepositoryOwner \
  -q '.headRepositoryOwner.login'
```

Note as `$OWNER`. Then:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json headRepository \
  -q '.headRepository.name'
```

Note as `$REPO`.

Verify the PR is eligible for the merge queue.
The base branch must be `main` and the PR must
not be cross-repository:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json baseRefName,isCrossRepository \
  -q '.baseRefName + " " + (.isCrossRepository | tostring)'
```

Stop if the base branch is not `main` or
`isCrossRepository` is `true`. The merge queue
workflow only runs for same-repo PRs targeting
`main`.

### 2. Verify readiness

Confirm CI is green, no review threads are
unresolved, and the latest commit has a Copilot
review before enqueuing.

Check CI:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR" --json name,state,bucket
```

`gh pr checks` returns two fields worth reading.
`state` is one of `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`,
`IN_PROGRESS`, `QUEUED`, `SKIPPING`. `bucket`
collapses those into `pass`, `fail`, `pending`,
`skipping`.

Every check must show `bucket = pass`. Stop if
any check is `pending`, `fail`, or otherwise
non-pass.

Check for unresolved review threads:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage }
        nodes { isResolved }
      }
    }
  }
}'  -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F pr="$PR"
```

Count entries where `isResolved` is `false`. Also
check `pageInfo.hasNextPage` — if `true`, there
are more than 100 threads and you must paginate
before trusting the count.

Stop if the count is greater than zero. Run
`/pr-fixup` first to address the remaining
threads.

Check that Copilot reviewed the latest commit:

```bash
gh api --paginate "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews" \
  -q '[.[] | select(.user.login ==
  "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]")]
  | last | .commit_id'
```

Compare the returned commit SHA with the PR head:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json commits \
  -q '.commits[-1].oid'
```

If the two SHAs do not match, Copilot has not
reviewed the latest push. Request a review and
wait before enqueuing:

```bash
gh api --method POST \
  "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR/requested_reviewers" \
  -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
```

### 3. Add the `queue` label

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --add-label queue
```

### 4. Monitor label progression

The action moves the PR through three labels:

| Label          | Meaning                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `queue`        | PR is waiting to be picked up     |
| `queue:active` | PR is in the current batch        |
| `queue:failed` | CI failed or merge conflict found |

Check the current label:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json labels \
  -q '.labels[].name'
```

Check the merge queue workflow run for the PR's
head branch (repo-wide listing would return
unrelated PRs when multiple are queued):

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefName \
  -q '.headRefName'
```

Note the branch as `$BRANCH`, then:

```bash
gh run list --workflow merge-queue.yml \
  --branch "$BRANCH" --limit 1
```

### 5. Handle failure

If the label changes to `queue:failed`, read the
action's comment on the PR for the failure cause:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --comments
```

Fix the issue, push, then swap labels to
re-enter the queue:

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --remove-label queue:failed
```

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --add-label queue
```

### 6. Confirm merge

The PR is merged when `gh pr view "$PR"` shows
state `MERGED`. Report success and the merge
commit SHA:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json state,mergeCommit \
  -q '.state + " " + .mergeCommit.oid'
```
