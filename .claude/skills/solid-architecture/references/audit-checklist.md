title: Architecture audit checklist
summary: >-
  Concrete checklist for mdsmith's audit mode.
  Sweeps origin/main since the last checkpoint
  for boundary and SOLID violations, records
  findings in docs/development/architecture-
  audit.md, and schedules blockers as new plan
  files under plan/.

# Architecture audit checklist

Walk this list during an audit run. The
audit is a survey; do not edit offending
code in the same run. For each finding,
append an entry to
`docs/development/architecture-audit.md`
with:

- File(s) involved.
- Principle violated (one of: SRP, OCP,
  LSP, ISP, DIP) or layering rule
  ("dependency direction", "boundary
  contract", etc.).
- Severity: `blocker`, `tax`, or
  `nice-to-have`.
- Suggested fix (one sentence).

## Initial file

If `docs/development/architecture-audit.md`
does not exist, create it with this
shape:

```markdown

title: Architecture audit log
summary: >-
  Running log of SOLID and clean-architecture
  findings on origin/main. The solid-
  architecture skill (audit mode) appends
  here; blockers are also filed as plans.

# Architecture audit log

This file is maintained by the
solid-architecture skill in audit mode.
See [skill](../../.claude/skills/solid-architecture/SKILL.md).

## Audit YYYY-MM-DD (range:
<from-sha>..<to-sha>)

### blockers

### tax

### nice-to-have
```

Pick a starting SHA one month back unless
the user supplies a different baseline.

## Step 1: refresh the checkpoint

Find the last audit SHA in the audit log's
front matter (`audit-from:`). Diff against
`origin/main`:

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

```bash
git log --name-only --pretty=format: \
  "$AUDIT_FROM..origin/main" | sort -u
```

Capture the file list as `$TOUCHED`.

## Step 2: Go layering checks

For each Go file in `$TOUCHED`:

- Does it import only from lower layers?
  Cross-check against the layering map in
  `SKILL.md` §"Project layering".
- Is its package still answering one
  question? If the package has grown three
  new files in unrelated areas, flag it
  for split (SRP).
- Are new `rule.Rule` implementations
  using only `rule.*` interfaces and not
  reaching into `internal/engine`? (DIP)
- Does any new function in
  `internal/engine` only serve one rule?
  If so, flag it for relocation. (SRP)
- Are new interfaces minimal? An interface
  with one implementor is a smell unless
  it sits on a boundary. (ISP)
- Do any new error types add fields that
  callers ignore? Flag for simplification.
- Are there new packages named `util`,
  `common`, `helpers`, or `lib`? Always a
  blocker (SRP).

## Step 3: TypeScript layering checks

For each `.ts` file in `$TOUCHED` under
`editors/vscode/`:

- Does a command import another command?
  Flag (DIP).
- Did `extension.ts` gain logic? Flag — it
  should only call `wiring.ts` (SRP).
- Did `binary.ts` grow non-binary
  concerns? Flag (SRP).
- Are new tests new modules or new
  assertions on existing ones? New
  command modules without tests are
  blockers.
- Did `package.json` `contributes` gain a
  field with no owning module? Blocker.
- Did any command call `child_process`
  directly outside `binary.ts` or
  `commands/runner.ts`? Blocker (DIP).

## Step 4: cross-system contract checks

- Did the `.mdsmith.yml` schema gain a
  field? If yes, is it documented under
  `docs/reference/`? Is it backward
  compatible? If not, blocker.
- Did CLI flags change? Run
  `mdsmith help` and diff against the
  reference docs. Any renamed or removed
  flags are blockers without a
  deprecation window.
- Did the LSP server gain a capability?
  Is there a fixture test? Did the VS
  Code client opt into it (if expected
  to)?
- Did `npm/`, `python/`, or the plugin
  manifest gain logic that should live in
  the binary? Flag.
- Did a generated section marker syntax
  change in any way that breaks parsing
  of older markers? Blocker.

## Step 5: severity rubric

- **blocker** — violates dependency
  direction, breaks a published contract,
  or makes a future refactor materially
  harder. Schedule a fix before the next
  release. File a plan under `plan/` with
  a back-link to the audit entry.
- **tax** — works today but adds friction
  (e.g. a function in the wrong package,
  a rule with one-off settings). Schedule
  inside the next plan cycle; leave the
  entry in the audit log until picked up.
- **nice-to-have** — cosmetic (naming,
  small duplication, doc tightening).
  Batch into a cleanup commit when
  convenient.

## Step 6: record findings

Append to the audit log under a new
`## Audit YYYY-MM-DD (range: …)` section.
For each severity, list bullets:

```markdown
### blockers

- `internal/engine/foo.go`: imports
  `internal/rules/mds001-...`. Violates
  DIP — engine must not depend on rule
  packages. Fix by routing through
  `rule.Rule`.
```

Update the `audit-from:` field to the
current `origin/main` SHA. Then run
`mdsmith fix` on the audit log so any
catalog stays current.

## Step 7: schedule

For each blocker:

- Create a new plan file under `plan/`
  using the next available numeric
  prefix. Title format:
  `arch-fix-<short-slug>`. Reference the
  audit entry in the plan's "Context"
  section.
- Set the plan `status` to `🔲`.

For each tax and nice-to-have:

- Leave in the audit log. Mention in the
  next routine cleanup plan.

## Step 8: tell the user

Summarize: number of blockers, number of
tax, number of nice-to-have. List the new
plan filenames. Do not modify offending
code; the audit run is complete.

## Common skip cases

- Files under `testdata/` and
  `internal/rules/<id>/{good,bad}/` are
  fixtures; their architecture is by
  design.
- Generated section bodies (between
  `<?directive?>` markers) are
  auto-produced; review the directive
  parameters, not the body.
- Comments-only changes do not require an
  audit entry unless they document a
  contract that has changed.
- Vendored or generated Go code
  (`*_gen.go`, code under `internal/…/gen`)
  is excluded.
