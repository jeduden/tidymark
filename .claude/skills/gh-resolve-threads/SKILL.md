  GitHub MCP CANNOT resolve review threads and CANNOT

  still open", or any reference to PR review feedback.
  If already in the pr-fixup skill, still follow these
  steps for thread resolution — do not improvise.

# Resolve PR Review Threads via `gh` CLI

GitHub MCP cannot resolve threads or retrieve thread
IDs. Use `gh` CLI and GraphQL as described below. Run
each fenced block as its own Bash call — do not chain
with `&&`.

**Prerequisite:** You must be inside a git repo on the
PR's branch.

## Step 1 — Ensure `gh` is installed and authenticated

```bash
gh --version
```

If missing, install `gh` v2.92.0 from GitHub releases.
Run each block as its own Bash call so allowlist
prefix matching keeps working — every command starts
with an allowed prefix, with no leading shell
assignment, subshell, or `echo` pipe.

Download the linux_amd64 tarball:

```bash
curl -fsSL --max-time 600 \
  "https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.92.0/gh_2.92.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
  -o /tmp/gh.tar.gz
```

Verify the SHA256 before extracting. The hash below
matches the published checksums at this URL:

```text
https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.92.0/gh_2.92.0_checksums.txt
```

The heredoc keeps `sha256sum` as the leading command:

```bash
sha256sum -c - <<'EOF'
b57848131bdf0c229cd35e1f2a51aa718199858b2e728410b37e89a428943ec4  /tmp/gh.tar.gz
EOF
```

If `sha256sum -c` reports a mismatch, stop and report
the failure — do not run the unverified binary. For
non-amd64 Linux or macOS, fetch the matching hash
from the same checksums file before downloading.

```bash
tar xz -C /tmp -f /tmp/gh.tar.gz
```

Copy the binary into a directory on `$PATH`. Use
`/usr/local/bin/gh` for a system-wide install (needs
root):

```bash
cp /tmp/gh_2.92.0_linux_amd64/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/gh
```

Or use `$HOME/.local/bin/gh` for a user-local install
(no root needed; ensure that directory is on `$PATH`):

```bash
cp /tmp/gh_2.92.0_linux_amd64/bin/gh "$HOME/.local/bin/gh"
```

```bash
gh auth login --with-token <<< "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

If that fails (redirect blocked), try apt. Each line
is its own Bash call:

```bash
type -p wget >/dev/null
```

If that exits non-zero, install wget first (separate
block so `apt-get` is the leading command):

```bash
apt-get install wget -y
```

```bash
mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
```

Download the keyring directly to its destination
(no pipe, single-command):

```bash
wget -q -O /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Print the architecture in its own block:

```bash
dpkg --print-architecture
```

Substitute the printed value (e.g. `amd64`) for
`ARCH_PLACEHOLDER` in the heredoc below before
running. The `<<'EOF'` quoting prevents any shell
expansion inside the body — the literal text after
substitution is what gets written:

```bash
tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null <<'EOF'
deb [arch=ARCH_PLACEHOLDER signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main
EOF
```

```bash
apt-get update
```

```bash
apt-get install gh -y
```

If both fail, the user needs to allow
`release-assets.githubusercontent.com` or
`cli.github.com` in their network config.

Authenticate if needed:

```bash
gh auth status
```

```bash
gh auth login --with-token <<< "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

## Step 2 — Identify PR and repo

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

Note the number as `$PR`. Then:

```bash
gh pr view --json headRepository \
  -q '.headRepository.owner.login + "/" + .headRepository.name'
```

Note the repo (e.g. `owner/name`) as `$REPO`.

## Step 3 — Fetch review threads

The query accepts an optional `$cursor` variable so
the same snippet works for both the first page and
subsequent pages:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!, $cursor: String) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              body
              author { login }
              path
              line
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="${REPO%%/*}" -f repo="${REPO##*/}" -F pr="$PR"
```

Returns the first 100 threads (10 comments each). If
`pageInfo.hasNextPage` is `true`, rerun the same call
with `-f cursor="<endCursor>"` appended (using the
`endCursor` returned in the previous response). Repeat
until `hasNextPage` is `false`:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!, $cursor: String) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              body
              author { login }
              path
              line
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="${REPO%%/*}" -f repo="${REPO##*/}" \
   -F pr="$PR" -f cursor="<endCursor>"
```

Otherwise unresolved threads beyond the first 100 are
silently omitted.

For each unresolved thread, note its `id` and read the
comment at `comments.nodes[0]` to understand what to
fix and where.

## Step 4 — Address comments, commit, push

Make the code changes for each unresolved thread. Skip
threads you cannot or should not address. Then:

```bash
git add -A
```

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
```

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Note the branch as `$BRANCH`. Then:

```bash
git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

After every push, request a Copilot re-review so the
bot looks at the latest commit:

```bash
gh api --method POST \
  "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/requested_reviewers" \
  -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
```

## Step 5 — Resolve addressed threads

For each thread you addressed, resolve it using its
`id` from step 3:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($threadId: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
    thread { id isResolved }
  }
}' -f threadId="THREAD_NODE_ID"
```

Resolve one at a time. Do NOT resolve threads you did
not address.

## Step 6 — Verify

Re-run the step 3 query. Confirm addressed threads
show `"isResolved": true`. Report to the user what
was resolved and what remains open.
