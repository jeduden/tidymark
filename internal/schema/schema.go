// Package schema models the document-structure schemas that drive
// MDS020 (required-structure). A schema describes what a Markdown
// document's front matter, filename, and heading tree must look like.
//
// Two sources feed the same in-memory representation:
//
//   - Inline. A YAML schema block under kinds.<name>.schema: in
//     .mdsmith.yml.
//   - File. A proto.md file referenced by
//     rules.required-structure.schema: (the legacy heading-template
//     form).
//
// Both parse into a Schema whose Sections is a recursive tree of
// Scope nodes. The validator walks a document's AST against that
// tree, emitting diagnostics through the lint.Diagnostic shape.
//
// See plan/146_inline-schema-in-kinds.md for the design context.
