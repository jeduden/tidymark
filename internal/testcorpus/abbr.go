// AbbrHeavy is the abbreviation-heavy paragraph corpus that exercises
// trained Punkt's third-pass MultiPunctWordAnnotation. Every paragraph
// is built around period-rich tokens — initials, honorifics, dotted
// abbreviations, decimals, version numbers — exactly the input shape
// where the segmenter's per-token machinery is hottest. The corpus is
// imported by both mdtext's BenchmarkSplitSentences_Subset and the
// paragraph-structure rule's BenchmarkRule_MDS024 so both gates
// measure the same dose of the hot frame. See plan 193 task 1 for the
// rationale.

// AbbrHeavyParagraph joins AbbrHeavy into one long Markdown
// paragraph, matching how a real .md file looks when MDS024's
// per-paragraph segmenter runs on it. The benchmark for the rule
// uses this shape so the fixture is a single paragraph the rule
// extracts from the AST, not the slice of independent strings.
//
// The join logic itself is in joinWithSpace so the empty-slice
// branch can be tested without mutating the exported AbbrHeavy
// variable. Mutating AbbrHeavy from a test would race with other
// packages' parallel `go test ./...` runs (e.g. paragraph-structure's
// alloc-budget gate consumes the same corpus).
