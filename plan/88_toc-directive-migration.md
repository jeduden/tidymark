title: TOC directive migration aid
status: "🔲"
summary: >-
  New rule MDS035 that flags renderer-specific
  table-of-contents directives (`[TOC]`,
  `[[_TOC_]]`, `[[toc]]`, `${toc}`) that render
  as empty text on CommonMark / goldmark. The
  diagnostic points authors at mdsmith's
  `<?catalog?>` directive for the file-index use
  case; heading-level TOCs have no direct
  mdsmith equivalent.

# TOC directive migration aid

## Goal

Catch renderer-specific TOC directives that do
not render on CommonMark or goldmark. The
diagnostic tells authors which use case has a
mdsmith equivalent and which does not.

## Context

Four TOC directive variants appear in the wild:

- `[TOC]` — Python-Markdown, MultiMarkdown,
  Pandoc (with `--toc`)
- `[[_TOC_]]` — GitLab Flavored Markdown,
  Azure DevOps
- `[[toc]]` — markdown-it-toc-done-right,
  VitePress
- `${toc}` — some VitePress configurations

None are part of CommonMark, GFM, or goldmark.
On goldmark, `[TOC]` parses as a link reference
with no matching definition (renders as literal
text or an empty link). `[[_TOC_]]` and `[[toc]]`
parse as plain text in a paragraph. The
directive simply disappears from the rendered
output, which is a silent failure.

### Heading TOC vs file index

The flagged directives and
[`<?catalog?>`][catalog] solve different
problems:

| Directive      | Generates                                 | Input              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `[TOC]` et al. | Table of **headings in the current file** | Current doc        |
| `<?catalog?>`  | Table of **other files** matching a glob  | Glob + frontmatter |

[catalog]: ../internal/rules/MDS019-catalog/README.md

`<?catalog?>` is the right replacement only
when a directive is used on an index page to
list sibling or child documents (e.g. a wiki
homepage with `[[_TOC_]]` listing all pages in
the space). For in-document heading TOCs — the
more common case — mdsmith has no built-in
generator; the author must either drop the
directive or maintain a manual list.

### Why this rule, not MDS034

MDS034 ([plan 86](86_markdown-flavor-validation.md))
validates syntax support against a declared
flavor. TOC directives are not "flavor features"
— they are per-renderer conventions with no
canonical spec and no fix path that applies to
every call site. A dedicated opt-in rule with a
diagnostic tailored to the use-case distinction
above is a better fit than folding them into
MDS034's fix pipeline.

### Scope

Flag only the four directives above. Do not try
to auto-generate a `<?catalog?>` block — the
right glob and front-matter fields depend on the
project and are not knowable from the TOC call
site. The diagnostic is informational and names
both the file-index case (points to MDS019) and
the heading-TOC case (no equivalent).

## Design

### Detection

Line-level regex on the raw source, scoped to
paragraph nodes (skip code blocks, HTML blocks,
and inline code spans). Four patterns:

- `^\[TOC\]\s*$`
- `^\[\[_TOC_\]\]\s*$`
- `^\[\[toc\]\]\s*$`
- `^\$\{toc\}\s*$`

Goldmark parses `[TOC]` as a link reference node
and `[[_TOC_]]` / `[[toc]]` as text inside a
paragraph. AST detection would require
per-variant walkers; raw-line regex is simpler
and avoids false positives by restricting the
match to paragraph-only regions.

### Configuration

Rule `toc-directive`, category `meta`, disabled
by default (opt-in) — consistent with MDS034's
opt-in posture. No settings.

### Error message

```text
[TOC] does not render on CommonMark or goldmark; mdsmith has no heading-TOC generator. For file-index use cases, see <?catalog?> (MDS019).
```

Severity: `warning`.

### No auto-fix

The rule is detection-only. Whether the right
replacement is `<?catalog?>`, a manually
maintained list, or deletion depends on intent
that is not recoverable from the directive
alone.

## Tasks

1. Create `internal/rules/MDS035-toc-directive/`
   with `rule.go`, `README.md`
2. Implement paragraph-scoped line scanning for
   the four directive patterns
3. Implement `rule.Defaultable` with
   `EnabledByDefault` returning `false`
4. Register as MDS035 in category `meta`
5. Add good/bad fixtures with front-matter
   specifying the expected diagnostics
6. Document the rule in the flavor comparison
   table in
   [docs/background/markdown-linters.md](../docs/background/markdown-linters.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `[TOC]` on its own line produces a
      diagnostic that names both the heading-TOC
      gap and the `<?catalog?>` file-index
      alternative
- [ ] `[[_TOC_]]` on its own line produces the
      same diagnostic
- [ ] `[[toc]]` on its own line produces the
      same diagnostic
- [ ] `${toc}` on its own line produces the
      same diagnostic
- [ ] `[TOC]` inside a fenced code block
      produces no diagnostic
- [ ] `[TOC]` inside an inline code span
      produces no diagnostic
- [ ] `[TOC]` used as legitimate link text
      (with a matching `[TOC]: url` definition)
      produces no diagnostic
- [ ] Rule is disabled by default (opt-in)
- [ ] No auto-fix is applied
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no
      issues
