# Conciseness Metrics Design and Implementation

## Goal

Design and implement conciseness scoring metrics (heuristics, thresholds, and configuration) for mdsmith, backed by tests and documentation.

## Tasks

1. Specify candidate conciseness metrics and choose a baseline heuristic (filler/hedge ratios, content-to-token ratio, verbose phrase penalties).
2. Define tokenization and paragraph boundaries that align with existing mdtext utilities.
3. Calibrate default thresholds using a representative doc set and record false-positive risk.
4. Implement the conciseness rule with configurable thresholds, word/phrase lists, and per-path overrides.
5. Add unit tests and fixtures covering false positives, technical prose, and verbose-but-readable content.
6. Update rule docs and usage examples to explain configuration and trade-offs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conciseness metric is specified with documented heuristics and default thresholds.
- [ ] Rule is implemented with configurable settings and per-path overrides.
- [ ] Tests cover representative readable, technical, and verbose cases.
- [ ] Documentation explains how to tune conciseness thresholds and when to prefer other rules.
