title: MDS037 skips paragraphs inside generated sections
status: "✅"
summary: >-
  Paragraphs inside `<?include?>` and `<?catalog?>`
  directive bodies are copies of content owned by
  another file; MDS037 must not count them as
  cross-file duplicates.

# MDS037 skips paragraphs inside generated sections

Builds on redundancy detection work to skip paragraphs
inside generated sections (MDS037 duplicated-content).

## Goal

Stop MDS037 from flagging paragraphs produced by the
include or catalog directive. The rule then runs
cleanly on a project that shares prose across agent
instruction files or renders catalog tables from
front matter.

## Context

MDS037 walks paragraphs via `ast.KindParagraph` and
does not look at the surrounding processing
instructions. Two directives break that:

- `<?include file: X ?>` expands prose from `X`
  into the host file. After expansion the host file
  and `X` hold the same paragraph text on disk, and
  MDS037 reports each paragraph as duplicated.
  A single project often points two or three agent
  files at the same shared source; every run fires.
- `<?catalog glob: "..." ?>` renders a table or
  list whose row template pulls from each target's
  front matter (e.g. `{summary}`). When a target
  also states the same summary as a sentence in its
  body, the catalog row duplicates that sentence.
  The catalog block is a table today, so the line
  usually sits inside a table cell, but a row
  template can produce paragraph-shaped output too.

The ranges are easy to find. mdsmith parses the
open and close tags as `*lint.ProcessingInstruction`
siblings. The rule can map those to byte ranges
without re-parsing the file.

## Tasks

1. [x] Walk top-level AST once to build a list of
   generated-section byte ranges. A range starts at
   the opening PI's segment end and closes at the
   closing PI's segment start.
2. [x] In `extractParagraphs`, skip any paragraph whose
   first-line byte offset sits inside one of those
   ranges.
3. [x] Likewise skip the paragraph when the rule walks
   *other* files during corpus indexing — otherwise
   a host file would still match against source text
   the other file only carries because of its own
   generated section.
4. [x] Update the README to document this behavior and
   drop the recommendation to hand-exclude the host
   files.
5. [x] Add tests: include-expanded paragraph in host is
   not flagged; catalog-rendered paragraph in host
   is not flagged; duplicates outside generated
   sections still fire.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A paragraph in a file's body whose bytes sit
      between `<?include?>` / `<?/include?>` markers
      does not produce an MDS037 diagnostic.
- [x] Same for `<?catalog?>` / `<?/catalog?>`.
- [x] A real duplicate outside any generated
      section still fires.
- [x] `mdsmith check .` stays clean on this repo
      with MDS037 enabled in `.mdsmith.yml`.
- [x] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [x] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no issues
