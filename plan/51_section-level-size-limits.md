# Section-Level Size Limits

## Goal

Enforce size limits on individual Markdown sections
to prevent oversized headings from hiding in otherwise compliant files.

## Tasks

1. [x] Define section boundary detection rules for heading levels.
2. [x] Add configuration for per-heading or per-pattern limits.
3. [x] Implement rule to count section length by lines or tokens.
4. [x] Document configuration and examples.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rule enforces size limits per heading level or heading pattern.
- [x] Findings include the heading title and measured size.
- [x] Limits can be configured independently of file-level limits.
- [x] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [x] `golangci-lint run` reports no issues

## Notes

Implemented as MDS036 `section-size-limits`. A section spans from its
heading line up to (but not including) the next heading line of any
level, or end of file. Nested subsections are measured independently
of their parent, so the limit applies to direct content under each
heading. Lookup order for the applicable max: `per-heading` regex
(first match), `per-level`, `max`. Disabled by default; enable by
setting `max` (or any `per-level` / `per-heading` entry) to a positive
integer in `.mdsmith.yml`.
