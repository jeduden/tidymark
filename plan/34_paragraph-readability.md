# Paragraph Readability Score

## Goal

Add TM023 `paragraph-readability` that scores each
paragraph and warns when the grade is too high. This
pushes authors toward clearer prose. It uses the ARI
formula by default. The design lets us add other
formulas (such as Flesch-Kincaid) later.

## Tasks

### A. Shared plain text extraction

1. Create `internal/mdtext/` package with
   `ExtractPlainText(node ast.Node, source []byte) string`
   that strips markdown syntax:

  - Inline code: keep text content
  - Links: keep display text, drop URL
  - Emphasis/strong: keep inner text
  - Images: keep alt text

   This helper is shared with TM024
   (`paragraph-structure`).

2. Add `CountWords(text string) int` and
   `CountSentences(text string) int` to the same package.
   `CountSentences` splits on `.`, `!`, `?` followed by
   whitespace or end of text. Treat zero sentences as 1.

### B. Readability computation

3. Create `internal/rules/paragraphreadability/readability.go`
   with a `GradeFunc` type and an ARI implementation:

   ```go
   // GradeFunc computes a readability grade level from
   // plain text. Higher values mean harder to read.
   type GradeFunc func(text string) float64
   ```

   ARI formula:

   ```text
   4.71 * (characters / words)
     + 0.5 * (words / sentences)
     - 21.43
   ```

   Where `characters` counts letters and digits only
   (no spaces or punctuation).

4. Handle edge cases: single-word paragraphs, no
   sentences (treat as 1), empty text (return 0).

### C. Rule implementation

5. Create `internal/rules/paragraphreadability/rule.go`
   implementing `rule.Rule` and `rule.Configurable`.
   Settings:

   | Setting   | Type  | Default | Description                    |
   |-----------|-------|---------|--------------------------------|
   | `max-grade` | float | 14.0    | Max readability grade level    |
   | `min-words` | int   | 20      | Minimum words to trigger check |

   Paragraphs with fewer than `min-words` words are
   skipped (short paragraphs produce unreliable scores).

6. Check logic: walk the AST for `*ast.Paragraph` nodes.
   For each, extract plain text via `mdtext.ExtractPlainText`,
   count words, skip if below `min-words`, compute grade.
   If it exceeds `max-grade`, emit:

  - `paragraph readability grade too high (16.2 > 14.0)`

   Diagnostic on the paragraph's first line.

7. The rule struct holds a `GradeFunc` field, defaulting
   to ARI. This allows swapping to a different formula
   later without changing the rule logic.

8. Register rule, add blank import, set category to
   `"meta"`.

### D. Documentation

9. Write `rules/TM023-paragraph-readability/README.md`.

10. Create test fixtures with high-grade and low-grade
    paragraphs.

### E. Tests

11. Unit tests for `mdtext.ExtractPlainText`: links,
    emphasis, code spans, images, nested markup.

12. Unit tests for ARI: known reference texts with
    expected grade levels (within +-0.5 tolerance).

13. Unit tests for rule Check: paragraph over threshold,
    paragraph under threshold, short paragraph skipped,
    paragraph with inline markup.

14. Run `go test ./...` and `go tool golangci-lint run`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ARI grade computed for each paragraph
- [ ] Paragraphs below `min-words` skipped
- [ ] `max-grade` configurable, default 14.0
- [ ] Inline markup stripped before scoring
- [ ] `internal/mdtext/` shared package created
- [ ] `GradeFunc` abstraction supports future formulas
- [ ] Rule README with examples
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `golangci-lint run` reports no issues
