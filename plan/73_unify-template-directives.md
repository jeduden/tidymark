# Unify template and processing directives

Research for
[#68](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/68)
and
[#70](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/70).

Implementation plans:

- [74](74_directive-guide.md) -- directive guide
- [75](75_single-brace-placeholders.md) --
  `{field}` syntax for required-structure
- [76](76_rename-misleading-params.md) --
  rename misleading parameter names
- [77](77_template-composition-and-cycles.md) --
  template composition, cycle detection,
  `template` -> `schema` rename

## Blind trial design

Ten agents played "new developer." Each got a
two-sentence intro (max 50 words) and syntax
snippets. They guessed semantics and rated
confidence 1-5. Round 1 covered directives and
config (15 snippets). Round 2 covered the
remaining 25 rules.

## Results: confidence scores

| Snippet | Topic                       | Avg | Range |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----|-------|
| 1       | `<?catalog?>` pair            | 4.8 | 4-5   |
| 2       | `<?include?>` pair            | 4.8 | 4-5   |
| 3       | `<?require?>` single marker   | 4.0 | 2-5   |
| 4       | `<?allow-empty-section?>`     | 4.8 | 4-5   |
| 5       | `{{.id}}: {{.title}}` heading | 3.8 | 3-4   |
| 6       | catalog `row` table template  | 4.4 | 4-5   |
| 7       | `line-length` config          | 4.0 | 4-5   |
| 8       | config overrides            | 4.8 | 4-5   |
| 9       | CUE front-matter schema     | 4.4 | 4-5   |
| 10      | `{{.field}}` heading vs row   | 4.0 | 3-5   |
| 11      | 4-space indented directive  | 2.6 | 1-4   |
| 12      | nested directives in row    | 2.0 | 1-3   |
| 13      | empty section at EOF        | 4.6 | 3-5   |
| 14      | `paragraph-readability`       | 4.0 | 3-5   |
| 15      | `token-budget` with ratio     | 3.8 | 2-5   |

Round 2 (MDS002-MDS033): all simple style rules
scored confidence 5.

## Six areas of confusion

1. `{{.field}}` means "insert" in catalog but
   "match" in required-structure. All five
   participants flagged this as the top source
   of confusion. -> [plan 75](75_single-brace-placeholders.md)
2. 4-space indent silently kills directives.
   No diagnostic. Confidence 2.6, 4/5 called
   it a footgun. -> [plan 74](74_directive-guide.md)
3. Nested directives undefined. Confidence 2.0.
   Nobody could predict what happens.
   -> [plan 74](74_directive-guide.md)
4. Misleading parameter names: `ratio` (warning
   threshold?), `max-words` (per paragraph?),
   `variance` (statistical?).
   -> [plan 76](76_rename-misleading-params.md)
5. Users cannot predict which rules auto-fix.
   -> [plan 74](74_directive-guide.md)
6. `directory-structure: true` without `allowed`
   is a silent no-op.
   -> [plan 76](76_rename-misleading-params.md)

## What works well

- Self-describing names: `allow-empty-section`
  (4.8), `overrides` (4.8).
- Marker pairs intuitive: catalog and include
  both scored 4.8.
- CUE schema readable: `|` union and `?`
  optional read naturally (4.4).
- PIs are hidden on GitHub renders (intended).
- `{field}` renders as visible literal text on
  GitHub, making template placeholders readable
  in unprocessed files.

## Goal

Give each directive a clear "if X then Y" rule.
Write one guide covering all rules with
examples. Fix misleading names. Switch
required-structure to `{field}` single braces.

## Verification trial (post-change)

Re-ran 10 snippets with the guide, `{field}`
syntax, renamed params, and fixability table.

| Snippet | Topic                  | Before | After |
|---------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| 1       | `{field}` heading        | 3.8    | 4.6   |
| 2       | `{{.f}}` vs `{f}`          | 4.0    | 4.8   |
| 3       | 4-space indent         | 2.6    | 5.0   |
| 4       | nesting                | 2.0    | 4.8   |
| 5       | words-per-token        | 3.8    | 4.6   |
| 6       | max-words-per-sentence | n/a    | 5.0   |
| 7       | max-column-width-ratio | n/a    | 4.8   |
| 8       | dir-structure no-op    | n/a    | 4.6   |
| 9       | line-length fixable?   | ~2.5   | 5.0   |
| 10      | code-lang fixable?     | ~2.5   | 5.0   |

Key wins:

- Indent footgun: 2.6 -> 5.0 (guide warning)
- Nesting: 2.0 -> 4.8 (guide statement)
- Fixability: ~2.5 -> 5.0 (fixability table)
- No "threshold" misreadings of renamed params
- `{field}` vs `{{.field}}` clearly distinct

Remaining gaps:

- `directory-structure: true` no-op still
  confused 2/5. Plan 76 config warning needed.
- `<?require?>` in a normal file is silently
  ignored (5/5 flagged as confusing in
  template-vs-normal trial).
- `<?allow-empty-section?>` in a template does
  not propagate to documents (5/5 noted the
  misleading co-occurrence with `## ...`).
- Templates enforce headings and front matter
  only, not directives (2/5 uncertain about
  `<?catalog?>` in a template).

All three template-vs-normal gaps addressed
by plan 74 (guide section on templates).

## Hugo-user trial (5 participants)

Tested all 33 rules with agents primed as Hugo
users per
[#73](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/73).

Hugo-specific traps (confidence drops):

- `{{.title}}` vs Hugo's `{{ .Title }}`:
  case-sensitive key lookup silently returns
  empty string. 5/5 flagged.
- "Template" means validation schema, not
  rendering. 5/5 confused by the word reuse.
- Generated content committed to git: inverts
  Hugo's "never commit build output" model.
  5/5 called this disorienting.
- No nesting: Hugo shortcodes compose freely.
  5/5 expected nesting to work.
- `<?...?>` YAML quoting rules are alien vs
  Hugo's `{{< key="val" >}}`. 4/5 flagged.
- No template functions (`humanize`, etc.).
  3/5 reached for them.

What worked: simple style rules (5.0), config
overrides (5.0), self-describing names (5.0).

Confirmed prior findings: `max-words` misread
as per-paragraph (5/5), `variance` misread as
statistical (4/5).

All Hugo-specific gaps addressed by plan 74
(guide must include a "coming from Hugo"
section).

## Execution order

Plans 75, 76, 77 are independent of each
other and can land in any order. Plan 74 (the
guide) depends on all three and must land last.

75 (single-brace) ──┐
76 (param renames) ──┼──> 74 (guide)
77 (composition)  ──┘
