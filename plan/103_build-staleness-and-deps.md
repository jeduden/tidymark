title: Build target staleness and dependency tracking
status: "🔲"
summary: >-
  Make the `mdsmith fix` build pass
  Make/Bazel-style. Hash `(recipe spec ‖ sorted
  input contents ‖ output set)` into one
  ActionID per target and store it in
  `.mdsmith/build-cache.json`. Skip targets
  whose ActionID matches the cache and whose
  outputs all exist. Adds `--build-force` and
  `--build-check-stale` to `mdsmith fix`.

# Build target staleness and dependency tracking

## Goal

The build pass inside `mdsmith fix` (plan 115)
runs only the recipes whose declared inputs or
recipe spec have changed, or whose declared
outputs are missing. mdsmith hashes one
ActionID per target and stores it in JSON. The
next `fix` run skips fresh targets.

## Context

Plan 102 adds `inputs:` and `outputs:` to the
`<?build?>` directive. Plan 115 wires the
build pass into `mdsmith fix` and always
rebuilds every target. For doc trees with many
recipes this wastes time and floods git diffs
with regenerated artifacts whose inputs did
not change.

### Pattern borrowed from `cmd/go/internal/cache`

Go's build cache hashes `(action description ‖
input contents)` into an ActionID and keys
results by it. The package is `internal/` but
the model fits: inputs are content-addressed
(not mtime), recipe edits invalidate every
target using that recipe, the cache is a flat
`ActionID → outputs` map. mdsmith uses a JSON
file rather than a content-addressed store —
hundreds of targets, not millions. Content
hashing also beats mtime because git checkouts
and CI cache restores rarely preserve mtimes.

## Design

### Recipe-default inputs

Recipes may declare implicit inputs in
`build.recipes.NAME.default-inputs`. Each
entry is a literal relative path or a
`{param}` token. Example:

```yaml
build:
  recipes:
    vhs:
      command: "vhs {tape}"
      params:
        required: [tape]
      default-inputs: ["{tape}"]
```

A directive supplying `tape: demo.tape` has
its effective input set computed as
`{ demo.tape } ∪ directive.inputs`. Authors
do not restate the recipe's own source file.

### ActionID

The ActionID is sha256 of the concatenation
of these fields. Each field is prefixed with
its byte length (8 bytes big-endian). Fields,
in order:

```text
recipe.command
canonical(directive.params)         (key=value\0 pairs, sorted)
canonical(sorted resolved inputs)   (path\0 entries)
concat(sha256(content) per input, same order)
canonical(sorted resolved outputs)  (path\0 entries)
cache.version
```

Length-prefixing prevents path-collision
attacks where a NUL or sentinel byte
collapses two input sets into one hash. Plan
102 rejects NUL and newline in declared
paths. Resolved glob matches could still
contain control bytes from hostile
filenames; the length frame makes that
benign.

`cache.version` lets a future mdsmith
release rev the schema and force a single
rebuild without crashing on stale entries.

### Staleness check

Per target, in order:

1. Resolve `inputs` (directive `inputs` ∪
   recipe `default-inputs`); if any non-glob
   entry is missing → build error.
2. If any entry in `outputs` does not exist
   on disk → stale.
3. Compute the ActionID.
4. Look up the target's cache entry by
   sorted-output-set key. If absent or
   stored ActionID differs → stale.
5. Hash each declared output's current
   on-disk content. If the hash differs from
   the cache entry's stored output hash →
   stale (the artifact was tampered with or
   regenerated externally).
6. Otherwise → fresh; skip the recipe.

Step 5 protects against a poisoned cache or
a hand-edited artifact masking as fresh. The
output-hash check is what makes the cache
*advisory* rather than authoritative.

A target is identified in the cache by its
sorted `outputs` list, length-framed and
joined. Any overlap across two directives'
`outputs:` paths is a build error reporting
both source locations. Overlap covers exact
path collisions and directory-prefix
collisions (one target declares `book/`,
another declares `book/index.html`). Without
this rule cache ownership is ambiguous and
serial builds become "last writer wins";
plan 116 reuses the rule for parallel safety.

### Cache file

Stored at `.mdsmith/build-cache.json`. Each
entry has:

- `outputs[]`: `{path, hash}` pairs sorted by
  path. `hash` is sha256 of the artifact at
  build time, used by staleness step 5.
- `inputs[]`: sorted, post-glob-expansion
  paths. Informational; the ActionID covers
  their content.
- `action-id`: the length-framed sha256.
- `recipe`, `built-at`: informational only.
  Neither is part of the ActionID; neither
  is consulted by the staleness check.

All paths are stored relative to the project
root.

Cache writes are atomic: write to
`.mdsmith/build-cache.json.tmp` and rename. A
mid-build crash leaves the previous cache
readable.

`.mdsmith/` goes into a recommended
`.gitignore` snippet — per-clone state, like
`node_modules/`.

### Flags on `mdsmith fix`

Extends plan 115's build-pass flag set:

| Flag                  | Behavior                                                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (none)                | Build only stale targets; refresh cache for rebuilt                     |
| `--build-force`       | Build every target; refresh all cache entries                           |
| `--build-check-stale` | Print every stale target, exit non-zero if any are stale, run no recipe |
| `--build-no-cache`    | Treat all targets as stale; do not read or write the cache (debugging)  |

`--build-check-stale` makes "every artifact is
up to date with its source" a CI signal a
reviewer can trust. The lint-fix pass still
runs unless combined with `--build-only`.

### Interaction with plan 115

- The build pass calls the staleness check
  before invoking `Builder.Build`. Fresh
  targets are skipped silently.
- Per-target summary: `OK` (recipe ran and
  succeeded), `FAIL` (recipe ran and failed),
  `SKIP` (target was fresh).
- `--build-dry-run` (plan 115) gains a
  staleness verdict per target
  (`STALE | FRESH`).

### Out of scope

Reverse dependency tracking, watch mode,
cross-machine cache sharing, tool-version
hashing. Parallel builds are tracked
separately (plan 116).

## Tasks

1. Extend `RecipeCfg` in `internal/config/`
   with `DefaultInputs []string`. Validate
   each entry is `{param}` (param declared,
   not reserved) or a literal relative path
   with no `..`. Add coverage in MDS040.
2. Implement `internal/build/cache.go`:
   load/save `.mdsmith/build-cache.json`,
   atomic write via temp+rename, version
   field, lookup by sorted output-set key.
3. Implement `internal/build/staleness.go`:
   resolve directive `inputs` ∪ recipe
   `default-inputs`, expand globs, compute
   the length-framed ActionID, check output
   presence and content hash, return
   `STALE | FRESH | ERROR` per target.
   On rebuild, hash each output and store
   in the cache entry.
4. Detect any overlap across declared
   `outputs:` paths — exact path collisions
   and directory-prefix collisions
   (`book/` vs `book/index.html`). Report a
   clear error naming both source locations;
   do not run either recipe.
5. Wire staleness into the `mdsmith fix`
   build pass (plan 115). Default skips
   fresh; refresh cache entries for rebuilt
   targets; atomic cache write at the end of
   the run. Per-target summary gains `SKIP`.
6. Add flags `--build-force`,
   `--build-check-stale`, `--build-no-cache`.
   Update `--build-dry-run` (plan 115) to
   print `STALE | FRESH` per target.
7. Integration tests:

  - `cp`-based recipe with `inputs:
    [src.txt]` skips on second `fix` run;
    rebuilds when `src.txt` content changes.
  - Touching `src.txt` mtime without changing
    content does not trigger a rebuild.
  - Editing the recipe `command` in
    `.mdsmith.yml` triggers a rebuild for
    all targets using it.
  - A two-output directive rebuilds when
    either output is deleted from disk.
  - A glob `inputs:` entry that matches zero
    files is a build error.
  - Overlapping `outputs:` paths (exact
    duplicates or directory-prefix
    collisions) is a build error.
  - `--build-force` rebuilds even when fresh.
  - `--build-check-stale` exits non-zero
    with stale output and zero with fresh
    output; no recipe runs.
  - `--build-no-cache` rebuilds everything
    and writes nothing to cache.

8. Document the staleness model and cache
   file in `docs/guides/directives/build.md`.
   Add the `.mdsmith/` ignore snippet to the
   README and to a future `mdsmith init`.
