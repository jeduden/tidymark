# Directive guide

Part of the user-model work from
[plan 73](73_unify-template-directives.md).
Addresses
[#70](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/70).

## Goal

One guide a developer reads to understand every
directive and rule without consulting per-rule
READMEs. Must also serve Hugo users per
[#73](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/73).

## Context

Blind trials (plan 73) showed six gaps that
docs alone can close:

- 4-space indent silently breaks directives
  (confidence 2.6, no diagnostic emitted).
- Nested directives are undefined (confidence
  2.0, nobody could predict behavior).
- Users cannot predict which rules auto-fix
  (fix confidence 2-3 points lower than check).
- `<?require?>` in a normal file is silently
  ignored (5/5 flagged as confusing -- looks
  like it should work anywhere).
- `<?allow-empty-section?>` in a template does
  not propagate to documents using that
  template (5/5 noted the misleading
  co-occurrence with `## ...`).
- Templates only enforce headings and front
  matter, not directives (2/5 uncertain
  whether `<?catalog?>` in a template requires
  documents to also contain one).

## Rendering note

Processing instructions (`<?...?>`) are hidden
by GitHub's Markdown renderer (CommonMark
type-3 HTML blocks). Directives stay invisible
in rendered docs. Generated content between
markers is visible.

## Tasks

1. Create `docs/guides/directives.md` with:

  - Quick-reference table: name, purpose,
    closing tag (yes/no), fixable (yes/no),
    parameters
  - Two kinds of markers: closing tag means
    `fix` regenerates body; no closing tag means
    `check` validates a condition
  - Placement rules: max 3-space indent, not
    inside fenced code or HTML blocks
  - Explicit warning: 4 spaces turns directive
    into a code block with no error
  - Each directive section: purpose, all
    parameters, good example, bad example, what
    `check` reports, what `fix` does
  - Nesting: state that directives inside
    generated content are not re-processed
  - Template vs normal file section: explain
    that `<?require?>` only works in templates,
    that `<?allow-empty-section?>` does not
    propagate from template to document, and
    that templates enforce headings and front
    matter only (not directives)
  - Fixability summary table for all 33 rules
  - "Coming from Hugo" section covering:
    `{{.title}}` is case-sensitive (not
    `.Title`), "template" means validation
    schema not rendering, generated content is
    committed to git (not gitignored), no
    nesting or composition, no template
    functions, directive params are YAML strings
    (per [#73](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/73))

2. Add a "see the directive guide" link from
   each rule README that uses a directive
   (MDS019, MDS020, MDS021, MDS030).
3. Run `mdsmith fix docs/guides/directives.md`
   to regenerate any catalog/include sections.
4. Run `mdsmith check docs/guides/` to verify.

## Acceptance Criteria

      examples

      rules

- [ ] Guide states nesting is not supported
- [ ] Guide has template-vs-normal-file section
- [ ] Guide states `<?require?>` is
      template-only
- [ ] Guide states template directives do not
      propagate to documents
- [ ] Guide has "coming from Hugo" section
- [ ] Guide passes `mdsmith check docs/guides/`
- [ ] Rule READMEs link to the guide
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no
      issues
