# Directive guide

Part of the user-model work from
[plan 73](73_unify-template-directives.md).
Sibling plans:

- [75](75_single-brace-placeholders.md) --
  `{field}` syntax
- [76](76_rename-misleading-params.md) --
  param renames
- [77](77_template-composition-and-cycles.md) --
  composition, cycles, `schema` rename

Addresses
[#68](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/68),
[#70](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/70).

## Goal

One guide a developer reads to understand every
directive and rule without consulting per-rule
READMEs. Must also serve Hugo users per
[#73](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/73).

Depends on: plans 75, 76, 77 (guide documents
the final syntax, parameter names, and schema
composition). Write the guide last so it
reflects all changes:

- Plan 75: `{field}` replaces `{{.field}}` in
  required-structure headings.
- Plan 76: `ratio` -> `words-per-token`,
  `max-words` -> `max-words-per-sentence`,
  `max-column-width-variance` -> `max-column-width-ratio`;
  "did you mean?" hint for case-mismatched
  front-matter keys in catalog.
- Plan 77: config key `template` -> `schema`;
  `<?include?>` works in schema files for
  composition; cycle detection with max depth
  10; `<?require?>` in non-schema files emits
  a warning.

## Context

Blind trials (plan 73) showed six gaps that
docs alone can close:

- 4-space indent silently breaks directives
  (confidence 2.6, no diagnostic emitted).
- Nested directives are undefined (confidence
  2.0, nobody could predict behavior).
- Users cannot predict which rules auto-fix
  (fix confidence 2-3 points lower than check).
- `<?require?>` in a normal file is silently
  ignored (5/5 flagged as confusing -- looks
  like it should work anywhere).
- `<?allow-empty-section?>` in a template does
  not propagate to documents using that
  template (5/5 noted the misleading
  co-occurrence with `## ...`).
- Templates only enforce headings and front
  matter, not directives (2/5 uncertain
  whether `<?catalog?>` in a template requires
  documents to also contain one).

## Rendering note

Processing instructions (`<?...?>`) are hidden
by GitHub's Markdown renderer (CommonMark
type-3 HTML blocks). Directives stay invisible
in rendered docs. Generated content between
markers is visible.

## Tasks

1. Create `docs/guides/directives.md` with:

  - Quick-reference table: name, purpose,
    closing tag (yes/no), fixable (yes/no),
    parameters
  - Two kinds of markers: closing tag means
    `fix` regenerates body; no closing tag means
    `check` validates a condition
  - Placement rules: max 3-space indent, not
    inside fenced code or HTML blocks
  - Explicit warning: 4 spaces turns directive
    into a code block with no error
  - Each directive section: purpose, all
    parameters, good example, bad example, what
    `check` reports, what `fix` does
  - Nesting: state that directives inside
    generated content are not re-processed
  - Template syntax section: `{field}` in
    schema headings (plan 75) vs `{{.field}}`
    in catalog rows; explain the difference
  - Schema vs normal file section: explain
    that `<?require?>` only works in schema
    files (plan 77 adds a warning for misuse),
    that `<?allow-empty-section?>` does not
    propagate from schema to document, and
    that schemas enforce headings and front
    matter only (not directives)
  - Schema composition: `<?include?>` in
    schema files splices headings (plan 77);
    cycle detection with max depth 10
  - Fixability summary table for all 33 rules
  - Renamed parameters: `words-per-token`,
    `max-words-per-sentence`,
    `max-column-width-ratio` (plan 76)
  - "Coming from Hugo" section covering:
    `{{.title}}` is case-sensitive (not
    `.Title`) with "did you mean?" hint
    (plan 76), `schema` is a validation
    contract not a rendering template
    (plan 77), generated content is committed
    to git (not gitignored), schema files can
    compose via `<?include?>` (plan 77), no
    nesting in normal files, no template
    functions, directive params are YAML
    strings
    (per [#73](https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith/issues/73))

2. Add a "see the directive guide" link from
   each rule README that uses a directive
   (MDS019, MDS020, MDS021, MDS030).
3. Run `mdsmith fix docs/guides/directives.md`
   to regenerate any catalog/include sections.
4. Run `mdsmith check docs/guides/` to verify.
