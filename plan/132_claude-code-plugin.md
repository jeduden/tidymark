title: Package mdsmith LSP as a Claude Code plugin
status: "🔲"
model: sonnet
summary: >-
  Ship a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plus a
  plugin manifest declaring `lspServers` so Claude
  Code can install mdsmith from this repository and
  auto-spawn `mdsmith lsp` on `.md` files, exposing
  diagnostics, definitions, references, symbols,
  implementations, and call hierarchy to the agent
  without manual editor setup.

# Package mdsmith LSP as a Claude Code plugin

## Goal

Let a Claude Code user install mdsmith with one
command: `/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith`.
After install, the agent sees Markdown diagnostics
inline after every edit. The agent can also use
go-to-definition, find references, symbol search,
and call hierarchy across the docs.

## Background

Claude Code's [code intelligence][cc-ci] bundles
LSP plugins for a fixed set of languages
(`gopls-lsp`, `pyright-lsp`, `typescript-lsp`, …).
Markdown is not on the list. The same docs note
that users can [create their own LSP plugin][cc-lsp]
for languages outside the bundle.

[cc-ci]: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence
[cc-lsp]: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers

Plan 121 shipped `mdsmith lsp` over stdio with
diagnostics and code actions. Plan 131 added the
six navigation methods Claude Code consumes
(`documentSymbol`, `definition`, `implementation`,
`references`, `workspace/symbol`, `callHierarchy`).
The server is wire-ready; only the Claude Code
discovery layer is missing. Today a user has to
hand-edit settings to spawn the binary.

## Non-Goals

- Bundling the `mdsmith` binary inside the plugin.
  The binary ships through the channels in plan 130
  (npm, PyPI, asdf, mise, GitHub release, VS Code
  marketplace). The plugin documents the binary
  prerequisite the same way `gopls-lsp` documents
  `gopls`.
- Authoring tools (slash commands, agents, hooks).
  Scope is the LSP wiring only.
- Submitting to the official Anthropic marketplace.
  This plan only ships a self-hosted marketplace
  inside `jeduden/mdsmith`; submission is a separate
  decision.

## Design

### Repository layout

```text
.claude-plugin/
  marketplace.json        # marketplace catalog at repo root
editors/
  claude-code/
    .claude-plugin/
      plugin.json         # plugin manifest with lspServers
    README.md             # install + binary prerequisite
  vscode/                 # existing VS Code extension
```

The marketplace at the repo root lists one plugin
sourced from `./editors/claude-code/`. This mirrors
the per-editor split already in place under
[editors/](../editors/) and keeps the VS Code
extension untouched.

### `marketplace.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin-marketplace.json",
  "name": "mdsmith",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Jens-Uwe Eden",
    "url": "https://github.com/jeduden"
  },
  "description": "Markdown linter for Claude Code via LSP",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "mdsmith-lsp",
      "source": "./editors/claude-code",
      "description": "Inline mdsmith diagnostics and Markdown navigation"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `plugin.json`

The manifest uses the inline `lspServers` form so
the plugin ships in a single file. `extensionToLanguage`
maps both common Markdown extensions to the
`markdown` language identifier.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin-manifest.json",
  "name": "mdsmith-lsp",
  "description": "Inline mdsmith diagnostics and Markdown navigation via LSP",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith",
  "repository": "https://github.com/jeduden/mdsmith",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["markdown", "linter", "lsp"],
  "lspServers": {
    "mdsmith": {
      "command": "mdsmith",
      "args": ["lsp"],
      "extensionToLanguage": {
        ".md": "markdown",
        ".markdown": "markdown"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `command` resolves against `$PATH`. Users who
installed `mdsmith` via npm, PyPI, asdf, or mise
(plan 130) get the binary on `$PATH` automatically.
Users with a custom path can override
`mdsmithLspPath` (no per-plugin config exists yet,
so the documented fallback is to put the binary on
`$PATH`).

### Discovery and install

Two install paths, both standard Claude Code flows:

- `/plugin marketplace add jeduden/mdsmith` then
  `/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith` (browse and
  install from the catalog).
- Direct: `/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith`
  after the marketplace is added.

After install, `/reload-plugins` activates the
server. Subsequent `.md` opens trigger
`textDocument/didOpen` and the diagnostics flow.

### Backwards compatibility

The plugin manifest is additive. The repo's
existing VS Code extension, npm scripts, and CI are
untouched. Users on other editors keep using the
documented stdio invocation.

## Tasks

1. Add `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the
   repository root with one plugin entry pointing
   to `./editors/claude-code`.
2. Add `editors/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   declaring the inline `lspServers` block above.
3. Add `editors/claude-code/README.md` with:
   install command, binary prerequisite, pointer
   to [the install guide](../docs/guides/install.md)
   for the binary, troubleshooting (the same
   `Executable not found in $PATH` failure mode the
   Claude Code docs warn about).
4. Add a "Claude Code" section to
   [`docs/guides/install.md`](../docs/guides/install.md)
   listing the two `/plugin` commands and linking
   to the new editor README.
5. Add the new plugin paths to
   [`.mdsmith.yml`](../.mdsmith.yml)'s `ignore:`
   only if they hold non-Markdown JSON that triggers
   no-bare-urls or similar; otherwise leave as-is.
   This change is config-touching, so surface the
   diff before applying per
   [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).
6. Validate the manifest locally with
   `claude plugin validate ./editors/claude-code` (or
   `/plugin validate` inside an active Claude Code
   session).
7. Smoke-test end-to-end: in a scratch repo, run
   `/plugin marketplace add ./` (pointing at a
   local clone), `/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith`,
   open a `.md` file with a known violation, confirm
   the diagnostic appears in Claude Code's output,
   and confirm a navigation request (e.g.
   `definition` on an anchor link) round-trips.
8. Add the plugin install path to
   [`docs/reference/cli/lsp.md`](../docs/reference/cli/lsp.md)
   alongside the existing VS Code pointer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/plugin marketplace add jeduden/mdsmith`
      registers the marketplace without errors.
- [ ] `/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith` installs
      the plugin to user scope.
- [ ] After install and `/reload-plugins`, opening
      a `.md` file with a known MDS rule violation
      surfaces the diagnostic to the agent (visible
      via Ctrl+O when the "diagnostics found"
      indicator appears).
- [ ] After install, the agent can run
      `textDocument/definition` on an anchor link
      and receive the heading location.
- [ ] `claude plugin validate` reports no errors on
      the new manifests.
- [ ] When the `mdsmith` binary is absent from
      `$PATH`, the `/plugin` Errors tab shows
      `Executable not found in $PATH` (no silent
      hang, no generic crash).
- [ ] [`docs/guides/install.md`](../docs/guides/install.md)
      documents the Claude Code install path and
      the binary prerequisite.
- [ ] `mdsmith check .` passes with the new files.
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`.

## Open Questions

- **Marketplace location.** Hosting under
  `jeduden/mdsmith` gates discovery on the
  upstream repo. A separate
  `jeduden/mdsmith-claude-plugin` repo would
  decouple plugin releases from binary releases
  but doubles the maintenance surface. Default to
  in-repo; revisit if release cadences diverge.
- **Plugin name collisions.** `mdsmith-lsp`
  matches the official plugin naming convention
  (`<tool>-lsp`). Confirm the name is unclaimed if
  the plugin is later submitted to the official
  Anthropic marketplace.
- **Binary version pinning.** The plugin will use
  whatever `mdsmith` version is on `$PATH`. If a
  future LSP capability requires a specific
  version, the plugin would need a version probe
  on `initialize`. Out of scope here.
