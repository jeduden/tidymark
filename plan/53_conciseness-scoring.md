# Conciseness Scoring

## Goal

Measure information density and flag verbose Markdown content
that remains readable but unnecessarily long.

Current state: heuristic prototype only. Keep rule disabled by default until
classifier-backed evaluation baselines are complete.

## Tasks

1. Define conciseness heuristics
   (filler words, hedge phrases, low content-to-token ratios).
2. Implement scoring per paragraph and configurable thresholds.
3. Emit warnings with suggested targets and examples.
4. Document configuration and rationale.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rule flags paragraphs that exceed a configurable verbosity threshold.
- [x] Output includes the paragraph location and conciseness score.
- [x] Heuristics are configurable and documented.
- [x] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [x] `golangci-lint run` reports no issues
- [ ] Rule is validated and ready for default enablement
