# Plan 66: Unified Conciseness Score

## Goal

Produce a single `float64` conciseness score per
paragraph. Use a pure-Go linear classifier with 14
features. Require zero external dependencies.

## Motivation

Six plans and seven open PRs address conciseness with
diverging approaches. This plan consolidates them into
one roadmap that produces a single number per paragraph:
a `float64` in `[0, 1]` where `1.0` means maximally
concise.

### Why this approach

We select the enhanced pure-Go linear classifier because:

1. **Infrastructure exists.** PR #33 has the classifier,
   embedded weights, checksum verification, and benchmark
   harness. 3.3 μs avg latency, +480 bytes binary,
   deterministic across runs.
2. **Zero dependencies.** Pure Go, `CGO_ENABLED=0`,
   single binary. No ONNX Runtime, no shared libraries,
   no Ollama, no Python at runtime.
3. **100 % deterministic.** Same input always produces
   the same score. Validated in PR #33 spike
   (`unique_hashes=1`).
4. **Extensible.** Adding features to a linear model is
   trivial. Each new feature is a pure-Go function that
   returns a `float64`. Retraining weights is a single
   Python script run offline.

### Merge order

1. PR #33 (plan 64) — base classifier
2. PR #35 (plan 62) — corpus
3. This plan's PR — extended features, retrained weights,
   MDS026 rule

PRs #21, #24, #31, #34 are closed with a comment linking
to this plan.

## Definition: The Conciseness Score

```text
conciseness ∈ [0.0, 1.0]

0.0 = maximally verbose (all filler, no content)
1.0 = maximally concise (every word carries meaning)
```

The score is the **sigmoid output** of a linear model
over paragraph-level features. The sigmoid maps to
`[0, 1]` and the model weights determine how each
feature contributes.

The MDS026 rule fires when `conciseness < threshold`
(default `0.5`, configurable in `.mdsmith.yml`).

```yaml
rules:
  paragraph-conciseness:
    min-score: 0.5     # paragraphs below this are flagged
```

Diagnostic format:

```text
README.md:14:1 MDS026 paragraph conciseness 0.38 …
```

## Features

The unified scorer extracts these features from each
paragraph. All are pure Go, zero external dependencies.

### Existing features (from PR #33)

Implemented in the classifier package:

- **filler_density** — filler words / total words
- **modal_density** — modal verbs / total words
- **vague_density** — vague words / total words
- **action_density** — action verbs / total words
- **hedge_density** — hedge phrases / total words
- **verbose_density** — verbose phrases / total words
- **stop_ratio** — stop words / total words

### New features (this plan)

| Feature           | Signal                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| compression_ratio | Redundancy via flate     |
| type_token_ratio  | Vocabulary repetition    |
| nominal_density   | Hidden verbs as nouns    |
| sent_len_variance | Sentence length spread   |
| func_word_ratio   | Function word dilution   |
| avg_word_length   | Word length distribution |
| ly_adverb_density | Adverb overuse           |

Total: 14 features (7 existing + 7 new).

```

### Weight retraining

After adding the new features, retrain the model:

1. Use the corpus from PR #35 (plan 62).
2. Extract all 14 features from each labeled paragraph.
3. Fit logistic regression (`sklearn.linear_model`).
4. Export weights and bias to `cue-linear-v2.json`.
5. Generate SHA-256 checksum for `go:embed` verification.
6. Validate determinism: assert `unique_hashes=1`.

The retraining script lives in `eval/conciseness/train/`
and runs offline when features or corpus change.

## Tasks

1. Merge PR #33 (plan 64 base classifier)
2. Merge PR #35 (plan 62 corpus)
3. Add 7 new feature extractors in `features.go`
4. Add feature tests in `features_test.go`
5. Retrain weights with 14 features, export v2 JSON
6. Implement `Scorer` interface in `scorer.go`
7. Implement MDS026 rule in `mds026.go`
8. Add MDS026 rule spec in `rules/` directory
9. Add config support for `min-score` threshold
10. Run determinism and benchmark validation
11. Close superseded PRs #21, #24, #31, #34

## Future: Transformer-Based Scoring

The pure-Go ML ecosystem is maturing. Two projects
deserve re-evaluation in Q3 2026:

- **GoMLX** (`gomlx/gomlx`) — pure-Go ML framework
  with transformer support and SIMD acceleration.
- **Hugot** (`knights-analytics/hugot`) — runs
  HuggingFace pipelines in pure Go.
- **gonnx** (`AdvancedClimateSystems/gonnx`) — pure-Go
  ONNX runtime, ~8x slower but zero C deps.

A fine-tuned small transformer could replace the linear
model for higher accuracy. Gate behind a build tag
(`-tags conciseness_ml`). The linear classifier remains
the default.

See issue #111 for tracking.
