title: No inline HTML rule
status: "🔲"
summary: >-
  New rule MDS039 that flags raw HTML in Markdown
  (block and inline), with an allowlist for tags that
  have no Markdown equivalent. Closes the largest
  attack surface for XSS and the largest source of
  parser ambiguity, per the bgslabs.org/why-are-we-
  using-markdown rant.

# No inline HTML rule

## Goal

Let users forbid raw HTML in their Markdown. Inline
HTML drives most XSS CVEs in Markdown renderers. It
also drives most parser ambiguity, since every
Markdown parser must also be a forgiving HTML parser.
Teams that adopt this rule keep their corpus in pure
Markdown plus the project's [directive
vocabulary](../docs/background/archetypes/generated-section/README.md).

## Background

### What counts as inline HTML

Goldmark's CommonMark parser produces two AST node
types for raw HTML:

- `*ast.HTMLBlock` — block-level HTML (a `<div>` on
  its own line, an HTML comment paragraph, a `<table>`
  block).
- `*ast.RawHTML` — inline HTML inside a paragraph
  (`text <span>marked</span> text`, `<br>`, `<kbd>x</kbd>`).

The PI block parser
([internal/lint/pi.go](../internal/lint/pi.go))
already replaces `<?name ... ?>` directives with a
distinct AST node, so directives are *not* HTMLBlocks
and will not be flagged by this rule. HTML comments
(`<!-- ... -->`) remain `*ast.HTMLBlock`s — see the
allowlist discussion below.

### Why a separate rule from MDS034

MDS034 (markdown-flavor) restricts which *Markdown
extensions* a file may use. Raw HTML is part of
CommonMark itself, so MDS034 cannot flag it without
overloading its meaning. A dedicated rule keeps the
two policies independently togglable: a team can
allow GFM tables but still forbid raw `<table>`.

### Prior art

- markdownlint's MD033 (`no-inline-html`) takes the
  same shape: a single boolean plus an `allowed_elements`
  list. We follow that interface so users migrating
  from markdownlint get a familiar knob.
- markdownlint flags by tag name (string). We do the
  same — the AST node carries the raw bytes, from
  which we extract the tag name with a small regex
  (`<\/?([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*)`).

## Design

### Configuration

```yaml
rules:
  no-inline-html:
    allow: []          # tag names that are permitted
    allow-comments: true   # <!-- ... --> stay legal by default
```

Category: `meta`. Disabled by default (opt-in) — the
mdsmith repo itself uses inline HTML in places (e.g.
`<sub>`, `<details>` in docs) and existing users
should not regress.

`allow` is a list-typed setting. It **replaces** by
default, matching the rest of the codebase except
`placeholders:`. A team that wants to extend the
default empty list does so by listing every tag they
need.

### Flavor activation

[Plan 112](112_flavor-profiles.md) ships profiles
that auto-enable this rule:

- `profile: portable` activates with empty
  `allow` and `allow-comments: true`.
- `profile: github` activates with
  `allow: [details, summary, sub, sup, kbd]`.
- `profile: plain` activates with empty `allow`
  and `allow-comments: false` (HTML comments leak
  through as literal text in plaintext readers).

User overrides on top of the profile still win via
deep-merge.

### Detection

Walk `f.AST`. For every `*ast.HTMLBlock` and every
`*ast.RawHTML`:

1. Extract the tag name (lowercase) from the raw
   bytes. If the bytes start with `<!--`, treat as a
   comment and skip when `allow-comments` is true.
2. If the tag name is in `allow`, skip.
3. Otherwise emit a diagnostic at the node's start
   line/column: `inline HTML <{tag}> is not allowed;
   use a Markdown construct or an mdsmith directive
   instead`.

Closing tags (`</div>`) emit no extra diagnostic —
the opening tag already produced one. Self-closing
tags (`<br/>`, `<img/>`) count once.

### What is *not* flagged

- Fenced and indented code blocks (the AST keeps
  these as `*ast.FencedCodeBlock` / `*ast.CodeBlock`,
  not HTML).
- Inline code spans (`*ast.CodeSpan`).
- Autolinks (`<https://example.com>`) and email
  autolinks — these are `*ast.AutoLink`, not RawHTML.
- mdsmith directives (`<?name ... ?>`) — already
  carved out by the PI parser.
- HTML entities in text (`&amp;`, `&#x2014;`) — these
  are `*ast.Text` after entity decoding; flagging
  them would be a separate rule.

### Auto-fix

No auto-fix in v1. The right replacement is
context-dependent: `<br>` may want `  \n`, `<b>` may
want `**`, `<details>` wants a future
`<?details?>` directive that does not exist yet.
Emitting a wrong fix is worse than emitting none.
Track a follow-up plan once a directive replacement
exists for the most common allowlisted tags.

### Error messages

Single message template, lowercase, no trailing
punctuation, per the project's code style:

```text
inline HTML <{tag}> is not allowed
```

When `allow-comments: false` flags a comment, the
tag is reported as `<!--` so the message stays
distinct.

## Tasks

1. Scaffold `internal/rules/noinlinehtml/` with
   `rule.go`, `rule_test.go`, and the `init()`
   `rule.Register` call.
2. Implement `Check()` walking the AST for
   `*ast.HTMLBlock` and `*ast.RawHTML`.
3. Add tag-name extraction helper with unit tests
   covering opening, closing, self-closing,
   uppercase, hyphenated (`<my-tag>`), and malformed
   inputs.
4. Implement `rule.Configurable` for `allow` and
   `allow-comments`; document `allow` as
   replace-mode in the rule's `ApplySettings`
   handler.
5. Implement `rule.Defaultable` returning `false`
   so the rule is opt-in.
6. Register as MDS039 in category `meta`.
7. Add fixture tests in
   `internal/rules/MDS039-no-inline-html/` with
   `good/` and `bad/` examples (paragraph with
   `<span>`, block with `<div>`, comment, allowlisted
   tag, directive, autolink — verify the directive
   and autolink fixtures stay clean).
8. Add rule README following the MDS012 template.
9. Update the docs catalog and the rule index so
   `<?catalog?>` regenerates the entry.
10. Run `mdsmith check .` and `go test ./...` until
    both pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `<div>...</div>` on its own line emits one
      diagnostic naming the `<div>` tag.
- [ ] `text <span>x</span> text` inside a paragraph
      emits one diagnostic naming the `<span>` tag.
- [ ] `<br/>` and `<br>` both emit exactly one
      diagnostic.
- [ ] A tag listed in `allow:` emits no diagnostic.
- [ ] `<!-- comment -->` emits no diagnostic when
      `allow-comments: true`, and one diagnostic
      naming `<!--` when `allow-comments: false`.
- [ ] `<?include file: foo.md ?>` and `<?catalog ... ?>`
      emit no diagnostic.
- [ ] `<https://example.com>` autolink emits no
      diagnostic.
- [ ] Fenced code blocks containing HTML emit no
      diagnostic.
- [ ] Rule is disabled by default; enabling it via
      `rules.no-inline-html: true` activates checking
      with empty allowlist.
- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] `go tool golangci-lint run` reports no issues
- [ ] `mdsmith check .` passes on the repo with the
      rule disabled (no regression for existing
      docs).
