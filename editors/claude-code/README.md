# mdsmith for Claude Code

Inline mdsmith diagnostics and Markdown navigation
for Claude Code, wired through `mdsmith lsp`.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add jeduden/mdsmith
/plugin install mdsmith-lsp@mdsmith
/reload-plugins
```

## Prerequisite

The plugin spawns `npx -y -p @mdsmith/cli mdsmith
lsp`. `npx` ships with Node.js, which Claude Code
already requires. First launch downloads
`@mdsmith/cli` and the platform binary subpackage
from npm; later launches reuse the npm cache.

To pin a specific build, install `mdsmith` via any
channel in the
[install guide](../../docs/guides/install.md). A
binary earlier on `$PATH` shadows the npx copy.

## Troubleshooting

If the `/plugin` Errors tab shows `Executable not
found in $PATH`, Node.js is missing from the shell
`$PATH` Claude Code sees. Install Node 20 LTS or
later, then run `/reload-plugins`.
