# mdsmith fix

Run `mdsmith fix` on the argument, defaulting
to `.` (entire workspace) when no argument is
given.

## Steps

1. Locate the workspace root:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

   Run every subsequent command from that path.
   Without `git`, use the current directory.

2. Detect the mdsmith CLI. Try, in order:

   ```bash
   mdsmith version
   ```

   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/mdsmith version
   ```

   If only the second succeeds, substitute
   `go run ./cmd/mdsmith` for `mdsmith` below.

3. Run the fix:

   ```bash
   mdsmith fix -- <path>
   ```

   where `<path>` is the skill argument, or `.`
   when none was given.

4. If the command exits non-zero, surface the
   full stderr to the user.

5. Report how many files were rewritten (parse
   the last line of stdout, which reads
   `N file(s) fixed`).

## Notes

`mdsmith fix` loops up to 10 passes. It exits
0 even when files change — a non-zero exit
means the CLI itself failed (binary missing,
config parse error, etc.).
