  Inspect declared file kinds and resolve the effective

Show the kinds assigned to a file (or all files) and
the merged rule config that results.

## When to invoke

Invoke when a user asks which kind a file belongs to,
which rules apply to it, or why a rule's settings
differ from the project defaults. The matching CLI
reference is
[`mdsmith kinds`](../../../../docs/reference/cli/kinds.md).

## Steps

### 1. Pick the subcommand

If the user passed a path argument, run `kinds
resolve` against that file. Note the value as
`$TARGET` and use `kinds resolve`. Otherwise run
`kinds list` to print every declared kind with its
merged body, then ask the user which file they want
to dig into.

### 2. Run mdsmith kinds

For a single file:

```bash
mdsmith kinds resolve -- "$TARGET"
```

For the workspace-wide list:

```bash
mdsmith kinds list
```

If the binary is not on `$PATH`, prepend
`npx -y -p @mdsmith/cli ` to either command.

### 3. Read the output

`kinds resolve` lists the file's effective kinds plus
each rule key that differs from defaults, with
per-leaf provenance. `kinds list` lists every
declared kind. Surface the relevant block back to
the user verbatim.

`kinds` exits 0 on success and 2 on a runtime or
configuration error (unknown kind, unreadable
file, malformed `.mdsmith.yml`, etc.); it does
not use exit 1. On exit 2 surface stderr so the
user sees the parse or load error.

## Notes

- Kind-assignment is order-sensitive; later entries
  layer on earlier ones via deep merge. See
  [file-kinds.md](../../../../docs/guides/file-kinds.md).
