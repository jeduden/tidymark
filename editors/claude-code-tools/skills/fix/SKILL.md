  Auto-fix lint issues in Markdown files in place by

  Markdown across many files to clean up trailing
  whitespace, line length, bare URLs, generated
  sections, and other fixable rules in one pass.

Run `mdsmith fix` on the workspace (or a passed
path) and report the fix-of-total stats line.

## When to invoke

Invoke after Markdown edits that may have introduced
auto-fixable issues. The matching CLI reference is
[`mdsmith fix`](../../../../docs/reference/cli/fix.md).

## Steps

### 1. Resolve the target path

If the user passed a path argument, use it. Otherwise
default to `.` (the workspace root).

Note the value as `$TARGET`.

### 2. Run mdsmith fix

```bash
mdsmith fix -- "$TARGET"
```

The `--` terminator stops `$TARGET` from being parsed
as a flag if a filename starts with `-`.

If the binary is not on `$PATH`, fall back to:

```bash
npx -y -p @mdsmith/cli mdsmith fix -- "$TARGET"
```

### 3. Report results

`mdsmith fix` prints a `stats:` summary line that
lists files checked, fixed, failures, and unfixed
issues. Quote that line back to the user.

Non-zero exit means at least one file still has
unfixable issues after the fix pass. Surface stderr
when that happens so the user sees the rule IDs and
file locations that need manual attention.

## Notes

- Generated section bodies (between `<?directive ...?>`
  and `<?/directive?>` markers) are regenerated, not
  hand-edited — see [generated sections][gs].
- `mdsmith fix` writes in place. Stage or stash
  any unrelated work first if a clean diff matters.
