Build and test reference for mdsmith contributors.

## Build & Test Commands

Requires Go 1.24+.

- `go build ./...` — build all packages
- `go test ./...` — run all tests
- `go test -run TestName ./...` — run a specific test
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .` — lint markdown
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith fix .` — auto-fix markdown
- `go tool golangci-lint run` — run linter
- `go vet ./...` — run go vet

## Project Layout

Follow the [standard Go project
layout](https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout):

- `cmd/mdsmith/` — main application entry point
- `internal/` — private packages not importable by
  other modules
- `internal/rules/` — rule documentation
  (`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/README.md`)
- `testdata/` — test fixtures (markdown files for
  testing rules)

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, goimports)
- Use golangci-lint for linting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Error messages should be lowercase, no trailing
  punctuation
- Prefer returning errors over panicking

## Test Fixtures

Rule test fixtures live in
`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/`. Each rule has `good/` and
`bad/` examples (or `good.md` / `bad.md`).

Good fixtures must pass **all** rules, not just their
own. When a good fixture uses non-default settings
(e.g. setext headings, tilde fences), add a matching
override in `.mdsmith.yml` so that `mdsmith check .`
also passes.

Bad fixtures are excluded via the `ignore:` section in
`.mdsmith.yml`.

When adding or changing a rule feature, add both:

1. **Unit tests** in `rule_test.go` (inline markdown,
   fast red/green cycle). Use `require` from testify
   for preconditions that abort the test and `assert`
   for checks that continue. Use `Same`/`NotSame` for
   pointer identity.
2. **Fixture tests** under `internal/rules/<id>-<name>/`
   (`good/` and `bad/` markdown files with YAML
   frontmatter specifying expected diagnostics). These
   are discovered automatically by the integration test
   runner in `internal/integration/rules_test.go`.

## Test Coverage

- `go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./...` — generate
  coverage profile
- `go tool cover -html=cover.out` — view in browser
- `go tool cover -func=cover.out` — print per-function
  summary

Use coverage to confirm Red/Green TDD cycles exercise
all code paths.

## Generated Sections

Content between `<?directive ... ?>` and
`<?/directive?>` markers is auto-generated. Do not
edit the body by hand — edit the directive parameters
or the source file it references, then run
`mdsmith fix <file>` to regenerate.

After merge conflicts in generated sections, run
`mdsmith fix <file>` to regenerate. The
`merge-driver` command automates this:

```bash
mdsmith merge-driver install [files...]
```

Run `mdsmith merge-driver install` once per clone.

## Documentation Types

mdsmith documentation follows four types. Place each
file in the matching directory:

| Type       | Directory          | Purpose                              | Example                             |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Guide      | `docs/guides/`     | Task-oriented: how to achieve a goal | "How to enforce document structure" |
| Reference  | `internal/rules/`  | Lookup-oriented: complete specs      | `internal/rules/index.md`           |
| Tutorial   | `docs/tutorials/`  | Learning-oriented: step-by-step      | "Your first schema"                 |
| Background | `docs/background/` | Understanding-oriented: context      | Comparison with other linters       |

When writing documentation:

- **Guides** answer "how do I...?" — start with a
  use case, show examples, link to reference for
  full details
- **References** answer "what is...?" — complete,
  accurate, generated where possible (use catalog
  directives)
- **Tutorials** answer "teach me..." — sequential
  steps, minimal prerequisites, concrete outcome
- **Background** answers "why...?" — context,
  trade-offs, comparisons, design rationale
