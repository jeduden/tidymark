Build and test reference for mdsmith contributors.

## Build & Test Commands

Requires Go 1.24+.

- `go build ./...` — build all packages
- `go test ./...` — run all tests
- `go test -run TestName ./...` — run a specific test
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith check .` — lint markdown
- `go run ./cmd/mdsmith fix .` — auto-fix markdown
- `go tool golangci-lint run` — run linter
- `go vet ./...` — run go vet

## Project Layout

Follow the [standard Go project
layout](https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout):

- `cmd/mdsmith/` — main application entry point
- `internal/` — private packages not importable by
  other modules
- `internal/rules/` — rule documentation
  (`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/README.md`)
- `testdata/` — test fixtures (markdown files for
  testing rules)

## Development Workflow

- Any change follows Red / Green TDD: write a failing
  test (red), make it pass (green), commit
- Keep commits small and focused on one change
- Run `mdsmith check .` before committing to ensure all
  markdown files pass linting

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, goimports)
- Use golangci-lint for linting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Error messages should be lowercase, no trailing
  punctuation
- Prefer returning errors over panicking

## PR Workflow

Use `gh` for all GitHub PR operations:

```bash
# View PR comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# List review comments on a PR
gh api "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner \
  -q '.nameWithOwner')/pulls/<number>/comments" \
  --paginate

# Push updates after addressing comments
git push origin <branch>
```

These commands are auto-approved in
`.claude/settings.json`.

## Plans

Task plans live in [`plan/`](plan/). See
[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the current status of all
plans. Use [`plan/proto.md`](plan/proto.md) as a
template when creating new plans.

Each plan has acceptance criteria with behavioral tests.
Work test-driven: write a failing test (red), make it
pass (green), commit.

Plan files must pass `mdsmith check plan/` with zero
diagnostics.

Use Markdown links when referring to real repo paths in
docs and plans. Bare backticked paths are allowed in
commands, code blocks, and placeholders. This lets
link-integrity checks validate real targets.

## Test Fixtures

Rule test fixtures live in
`internal/rules/<id>-<name>/`. Each rule has `good/` and
`bad/` examples (or `good.md` / `bad.md`).

Good fixtures must pass **all** rules, not just their
own. When a good fixture uses non-default settings
(e.g. setext headings, tilde fences), add a matching
override in `.mdsmith.yml` so that `mdsmith check .`
also passes.

Bad fixtures are excluded via the `ignore:` section in
`.mdsmith.yml`.

## Merge Conflicts in PLAN.md and README.md

[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) and [`README.md`](README.md)
contain auto-generated sections (catalog, include)
between an opening `<?name` ... `?>` (optionally with YAML)
and a closing `<?/name?>` marker. When two branches add items,
these sections conflict on merge.

**Resolution:** run `mdsmith fix <file>` after merging.
The fix command regenerates the content from front matter
or source files. Do not manually resolve section
conflicts — `mdsmith fix` overwrites the entire section
between the markers.

The built-in `merge-driver` command automates this. It
strips conflict markers inside regenerable sections, runs
`mdsmith fix`, and fails if unresolved markers remain.
Register it once per clone:

```bash
mdsmith merge-driver install [files...]
```

This adds `[merge "mdsmith"]` to `.git/config` and
updates [`.gitattributes`](.gitattributes) for the listed
files (default: PLAN.md, README.md).

## Cross-Platform Agent Config

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) is the primary source of
project conventions. mdsmith keeps these agent config
files in sync via include directives:

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md)

Edit CLAUDE.md or the shared source files; run
`mdsmith fix .` to propagate changes.
